Your SO made a shitty comment. Trust me, I am on my third baby. I love them, but those little traitors do that. Horrid inconsolable fits that make you question your abilities and test your limits, then suddenly, grandma or daddy shows up, and bam, your sweet little angel is back. I learned something though. You go ahead and take care of yourself, because as soon as the new wears off of them, that fussy baby will be back. 

Things that helped when mine went into inconsolable moments... the 5 s’s (swaddle, shush, swing, side or stomach, and I can’t remember the last one to save my life), my oldest LOVED her swing, but only going side to side, my second HATED a swaddle, but loved a noise machine, my baby is only 10 days old, so I don’t know about her yet._____Nta. Miscarriages are NOT punishment from God! It’s just some kind of incompatibility. It’s cruel of anyone to try to tell you that it is your fault, or punishment for something. I would have been upset if I had heard this, and I’ve never survived a miscarriage. Yes, it was not good for you to get physical, but attacking a person who is already hurting is not ok. One of the rules about helping injured animals is to be extremely careful, because they will very commonly attack as they feel vulnerable. 

If miscarriage were a punishment from God, why do so many overtly bad people have children? If God were able to pick and choose who is worthy to have children, why are there so many children in foster care and etc?_____ I am sure at this point you’re desperate for rest and you’re frustrated your child can’t get any either, so I’ll gloss over some of your complaints that prickle a bit. Your wife is so damn focused on breast feeding she’s not paying attention to the child’s needs and comfort. If she wants to continue, she needs to severely restrict her own diet because something she’s eating is hurting baby’s tummy. My cousin had one baby breastfed for a year, then had a double mastectomy, and a few years later, baby 2. BOTH kids are healthy, no allergies, no intolerances, literally no difference in the two kids. FED is best, breast milk’s BIGGEST advantage is that it’s cheaper._____. You’re pushing her and making her upset. Being a Nurse, she’s probably used to being on the go. It can be really hard to sit down and be stuck under a hungry baby. She may be having a bit of postpartum depression, and mom guilt, and you adding pressure won’t help at all. It is more important to have a happy and healthy mom than it is to have breastmilk. Having her feeling strong and confident as a parent will have better overall health effects. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with supplementing with formula. FED is best, the baby doesn’t care where the food comes from, and you need to introduce a bottle soon so that she learns to latch and drink from it, otherwise no one but mom will be able to feed her, and that will be a BIG problem.

Also, what do you think adopted babies drink? _____Yta. My god you’re exhausting! Stop! EVERYONE is saying this is a bad idea! It’s a bad idea!! For one, your baby is susceptible to germs and they’ll be traveling during a pandemic. For another, your wife has just produced an entire human from her body! She will be bleeding, trying to feed, and feel like absolute crap! She will now be able to sit comfortably. Every time she pees it will be horrible, god bless her the first time she poops, and that is if she does not have a c section (a MAJOR abdominal surgery) She is not going to want to feel like her and her baby are on display. She’s not going to want a house full of people, even if they do think they’re being helpful. This is the epitome of a bad idea_____Yta. What the heck did you guys think was going to happen?? No one thought to look for a long term solution instead of making a pregnant person, who is already telling you she’s tired, do it?? Do you know that pregnant people ore frequently out of lifting restrictions because of the risk of preterm labor? You e chosen to stay with your parents instead of going to the hospital with your pregnant wife. You’ve chosen to stay where you are instead of go to YOUR family (your wife and child). You could have gotten your dad into a nursing home for respite care for a week (basically a vacation), or put him in a nursing home until you could find a more suitable and long term situation.

I got a little... catty in a couple places and that's my bad, and I don't think you're necessarily a bad person. Just. Maybe have some things you can think about. And I guess you should know this is also coming from someone who doesn't necessarily have any preference for gender or even sex. It's all kind ""eh... nice"" to me. So my opinions are going to be far different from someone who is FIRMLY one way or the other, I just don't like the idea of using a strong word like ""disgust"" when it comes to your opinion on someone else, especially your own partner. Acceptance, kindness, and discussion is how things should be resolved (unless it's a nazi, then you punch them. but that's completely off topic).

Oh, the LGBTA community is NOT perfect at ALL. There's a lot of transphobia, racism, woman hating, and all that shit within. In that case though it's the few ruining it for ALL kind of a thing. There's a shit people in every community. Not everyone likes to acknowledge it though. 

Fair enough, dude. Like I said, I just ask that you reflect on it some more. It might help you with your issues you're having with your boyfriend right now. You have to start within before you can realize why you feel some of the things you feel. I don't think it's normal to feel disgusted by the fact your partner is Bi and has had a same sex relationship. In my book, that doesn't count as ""accepting"". _____That's where we're going to have to agree to disagree then. I don't think being ""disgusted"" by same sex relationships and calling yourself an ally go hand in hand. They're actually the opposites. You can be straight an be an ally but there's also the token ""straight ally"". Which is you're supportive so long as you don't have to see or think or be involved in anything not straight. 

Jesus fucking christ, that's the kind of information you need to fuckin' include in your ORIGINAL POST. Having ""racist thoughts"" and ""oh i dont date people of color because they're ugly but i like you because i got to know you"" is FUCKED UP. Still not the same thing, but a whole different level of ""dude you got issues."" Imma go with an official  now rather than a pure . 

Which is why it may be in your best interest, both of yours, to no longer be a couple. If you can't get past this, then there's no hope for your relationship. This is also why my first paragraph of this specific post is what i'm going to reference back to. You're an ally for others, but if you can't be it when you're in the situation you're an ""ally"". If you love him as much as you say you do, then this should just be a bump in the road. 

Well, that's another thing for the two of you two figure out as well. But after this situation, he might never be comfortable actually asking you for anal on himself. If you're acting this way finding out he's been with other dudes? Yeah. I don't think I'd ask you for anything specific in bed til my trust was rebuilt. _____We're only hearing of one specific situation, and in this situation, op is being a bully. 

I don't have a complex and wasn't bullied, actually. I spent time on the sidelines watching petty arguments and girls picking at each other and it was incredibly annoying and made it a pain in the ass to deal with and being asked to take sides.

Making a poll about another girl being attractive then sending her the negative results is NOT normal, thanks. It's being a bully and a bit of a bitch. _____ but i'm biased and share the same opinion as you. I love the idea of a customized, unique ring. I hate the idea of a diamond ring because of the industry and diamonds aren't rare, just highly controlled and monopolized. There are SO many better stones than a diamond!_____Those flamboyant gay men who are disgusted by vaginas and loud about it are usually the same type who think it's okay to touch a woman without their permission because ""i'm gay, sweetie, it doesn't matter"". It's a whole other problem on itself. And I do think that's a problem.

I think the problem here though is just being ""disgusted"" by it. Like, why the hell would be you be disgusted by it..? Just a ""nah, not for me"" would suffice? I think it's odd to call yourself an ally but be ""disgusted"" by what someone with a same sex partner might do. You're disgusted by the idea your boyfriend has had gay sex and you don't think that's odd? That you have THAT strong of feelings about it but can still accept other people doing it, as long as you don't have to think about it?

If that's how you feel, I guess it's how you feel. But food for thought and things to reflect on and all that jazz._____. Stop hiding your shitty behavior behind your religion. Jesus was a cool dude who hung out with homeless people, prostitutes, and hated the rich. I believe he'd 100% have respected a trans persons pronouns.

Fair enough, dude. Like I said, I just ask that you reflect on it some more. It might help you with your issues you're having with your boyfriend right now. You have to start within before you can realize why you feel some of the things you feel. I don't think it's normal to feel disgusted by the fact your partner is Bi and has had a same sex relationship. In my book, that doesn't count as ""accepting"". _____That's where we're going to have to agree to disagree then. I don't think being ""disgusted"" by same sex relationships and calling yourself an ally go hand in hand. They're actually the opposites. You can be straight an be an ally but there's also the token ""straight ally"". Which is you're supportive so long as you don't have to see or think or be involved in anything not straight. 

Jesus fucking christ, that's the kind of information you need to fuckin' include in your ORIGINAL POST. Having ""racist thoughts"" and ""oh i dont date people of color because they're ugly but i like you because i got to know you"" is FUCKED UP. Still not the same thing, but a whole different level of ""dude you got issues."" Imma go with an official  now rather than a pure . 

Which is why it may be in your best interest, both of yours, to no longer be a couple. If you can't get past this, then there's no hope for your relationship. This is also why my first paragraph of this specific post is what i'm going to reference back to. You're an ally for others, but if you can't be it when you're in the situation you're an ""ally"". If you love him as much as you say you do, then this should just be a bump in the road. 

Well, that's another thing for the two of you two figure out as well. But after this situation, he might never be comfortable actually asking you for anal on himself. If you're acting this way finding out he's been with other dudes? Yeah. I don't think I'd ask you for anything specific in bed til my trust was rebuilt. _____We're only hearing of one specific situation, and in this situation, op is being a bully. 

I don't have a complex and wasn't bullied, actually. I spent time on the sidelines watching petty arguments and girls picking at each other and it was incredibly annoying and made it a pain in the ass to deal with and being asked to take sides.

I'm only going to address the wedding issue and not talk about whatever other stuff you have against him because that's not what this is about. Yes, he should have thanked you nicer, but he has a right to invite whomever he wants to his wedding party. It's not owed. Just because his fiancee has a brother there doesn't mean he has to ""match"" like teenage fashion. How would you feel if you disliked your brother a lot but had to invite him to your wedding because people pressured you to, and then your brother got mad and refused to talk to you because you didn't go one step further and have him closely involved in your wedding planning? 

People don't invite people to wedding parties for many reasons: it's a lot of work, it's a lot of money, emotions are running high, family turns drama filled and crazy when weddings come around, and being near that makes everyone go crazy even if they're not like that other times. You have your reason for being upset: your idea of a wedding party is his including you, showing love, wanting you there, etc. His idea might be different. You don't know if he didn't invite you because he didn't want to put that kind of stress on you, or money obligations, whatever. You're assuming the worst - that he has wronged you somehow for having the wedding party of his choosing - and getting mad that he didn't run his wedding the way you wanted. I can get that it's upsetting and feels like a rejection, but refusing to talk to him is just retaliation: ""you don't want me? I don't want you either then!"" It's valid, but it's not any less petty. You can't force people to like you, and wedding inclusivity and closeness is not an obligation. You can decide that he's not that important to you and choose not to ask or talk to him, but make it a healthy choice, not a choice of vindictiveness (""HE needs to apologize for not wanting me closely involved in his wedding""). Also kinda  for putting your parents on the spot like that, like what was your father supposed to do, trash talk his son to his other son for your hurt feelings? Your hurt feelings are valid, but they don't necessarily mean that your brother is the villain here. _____.

  I told her that I wasn't going to allow her to turn into a slob like Mike

What is she, your kid? You sound super condescending. Your entire post is a series of random complaints about random things you hate about this guy, and they're all things you personally find unsavory, it's not like he ever went out of his way to harm you except for not cleaning up after himself - and for that, yes, you're entitled to be mad about it, and you're within your rights to tell your wife that you don't want a guest in the house that doesn't clean up after themselves. But by the way you talk you probably criticized him on a bunch of personal hygiene stuff that you personally dislike and what is your wife supposed to say to that? Agree with you that her beloved brother is disgusting because he's fat or eats a lot or is messy? Maybe try being a little less judgmental. You need to get on the same page about him being your house guest, and once you're able to say no to him coming, your irrational resentment might die down a little. _____.

Yes, it sucks that she couldn't say no to her husband who apparently treats her like shit. No, it's not your fault that her family refused to come. They obviously already have issues with this wedding and your gesture just gave them the fuel to follow suit. But if she's unable to stand her ground in complex in-law dynamics or a potentially shitty relationship, you yelling about not being given the seat of honor only put her between a rock and a hard place. If you're resentful about the resources and time you would not have spent had you not been promised that seat, ask her for compensation instead of refusing to come to a wedding because they won't give you an honorary title._____. It could be an honest mistake. It's your first birthday together. Guys remembering wedding anniversaries after so many years of marriage is so common that it's a trope. You can be disappointed but you can also choose to be an adult and understand that maybe she isn't out to get you, and ask her to remember or write it down next time. But you say she ""claims"" to have memory issues and go on to imply that she's probably lying. And you go on to say YOU remembered HER birthday, and therefore she owes it to remember your birthday. Scorekeeping and assuming that your SO is a liar is too immature a mindset for an adult relationship._____. This is the most common thread in all wedding advice columns. Their life is not about you and their engagement doesn't take away from yours. If your engagement bliss hinges on no one else around you being engaged as well, that's your own insecurity to work out, not other people's obligation to put their lives on hold for you.

  I know I should have said “please.”

No, you should have congratulated him. You could have chosen to be doubly happy for the double engagement, but you chose to be mad that you're not the only special one. You're a grown ass adult, learn to be happy without having to be the ""center of attention"". So what if your brother is doing it for attention? You're not acting any more mature by wanting to take that away from him. 

If you have a problem with your brother's habits like lying or disrespect, you can call him out on that instead of being bitter that he got engaged at a similar time to you. These things seem like your justification for your feeling that he's not allowed to be engaged at the same time as you. Focus on your own emotional intelligence and self awareness if you want to have a healthy adult life moving forward in marriage. _____. You can skip prom for whatever reason you want but you don't get to expose dirty laundry to a third party without your friend's permission. Now she has good reason not to trust you to respect your private conversations.

If you're resentful about the resources and time you would not have spent had you not been promised that seat, ask her for compensation instead of refusing to come to a wedding because they won't give you an honorary title._____. It could be an honest mistake. It's your first birthday together. Guys remembering wedding anniversaries after so many years of marriage is so common that it's a trope. You can be disappointed but you can also choose to be an adult and understand that maybe she isn't out to get you, and ask her to remember or write it down next time. But you say she ""claims"" to have memory issues and go on to imply that she's probably lying. And you go on to say YOU remembered HER birthday, and therefore she owes it to remember your birthday. Scorekeeping and assuming that your SO is a liar is too immature a mindset for an adult relationship._____. This is the most common thread in all wedding advice columns. Their life is not about you and their engagement doesn't take away from yours. If your engagement bliss hinges on no one else around you being engaged as well, that's your own insecurity to work out, not other people's obligation to put their lives on hold for you.

  I know I should have said “please.”

No, you should have congratulated him. You could have chosen to be doubly happy for the double engagement, but you chose to be mad that you're not the only special one. You're a grown ass adult, learn to be happy without having to be the ""center of attention"". So what if your brother is doing it for attention? You're not acting any more mature by wanting to take that away from him. 

If you have a problem with your brother's habits like lying or disrespect, you can call him out on that instead of being bitter that he got engaged at a similar time to you. These things seem like your justification for your feeling that he's not allowed to be engaged at the same time as you. Focus on your own emotional intelligence and self awareness if you want to have a healthy adult life moving forward in marriage. _____. You can skip prom for whatever reason you want but you don't get to expose dirty laundry to a third party without your friend's permission. Now she has good reason not to trust you to respect your private conversations.

People don't invite people to wedding parties for many reasons: it's a lot of work, it's a lot of money, emotions are running high, family turns drama filled and crazy when weddings come around, and being near that makes everyone go crazy even if they're not like that other times. You have your reason for being upset: your idea of a wedding party is his including you, showing love, wanting you there, etc. His idea might be different. You don't know if he didn't invite you because he didn't want to put that kind of stress on you, or money obligations, whatever. You're assuming the worst - that he has wronged you somehow for having the wedding party of his choosing - and getting mad that he didn't run his wedding the way you wanted. I can get that it's upsetting and feels like a rejection, but refusing to talk to him is just retaliation: ""you don't want me? I don't want you either then!"" It's valid, but it's not any less petty. You can't force people to like you, and wedding inclusivity and closeness is not an obligation. You can decide that he's not that important to you and choose not to ask or talk to him, but make it a healthy choice, not a choice of vindictiveness (""HE needs to apologize for not wanting me closely involved in his wedding"").

But by the way you talk you probably criticized him on a bunch of personal hygiene stuff that you personally dislike and what is your wife supposed to say to that?

or 



I don't care about the sex, although I hope you are being safe.

The weed I'm also fairly ambivalent about, especially if it is legal where you are.

Dropping acid, however...

1) Incredibly dangerous. LSD is one of the most dangerous drugs on the market for a variety of reasons. It is frequently contaminated with other things. Or faked altogether. Not to mention the things you might do while tripping.

2) Unpredictable. You might get a mild trip that involves you staring at a table for 12 hours. You might experience euphoria. You might achieve ""enlightment."" Or you might have a 10+ hour nightmare that breaks your mind. There are people that have had permanent psychotic breaks from a bad trip. And once started, a bad trip doesn't stop until the drug wears off.

3) Illegal everywhere. Now, this one might be a little out of date, but I'm mostly certain LSD is not legal anywhere in the world. That's a lot of risk to get high.

4) Unhealthy. Aside from the mental effects, LSD can have detrimental physical effects as well. And that's aside from whatever you might do to yourself while high.

5) Long-term. LSD can stay in the system for decades. People that haven't taken it in decades can experience a sudden trip or flaahback.

And you are risking a college education that your parents have undoubtedly worked hard to provide the money for you to go.

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?_____You'd be surprised how much murderous intent those dementia patients carry. I've been strangled, clocked over the head with a walker, stabbed at with at least 4 different objects (pen, set of keys, butterknife, fork, and a piece of broken plastic offhand), nearly set on fire (whoever let the damn woman keep her lighter after smoking was an ass!), and had my head slammed in a doorway. I've also had my arm nearly torn off, various sprains, and a host of other injuries.

OP has expressly stated repeatedly that she isn't ditching him to rot. Just to get away from him directly, which I feel is the correct action. She has no training or ability to deal with this._____Several. I work in healthcare, for one. I have to be knowledgeable about things like that, because it affects the care the patient receives. I live in North Carolina - Duke, Wake Forest, and UNC hospitals are all around me, and I have spoken extensively to several of the doctors - leaders in the field - about exactly these types of conditions, because I often go to appointments with my clients. Furthermore, members of my family have certain of those issues, as does a close friend. I can't give you websites or books, however.

Alao, please note I'm not saying these disorders are going to affect everyone equally. It depends on people's individual biology to a great extent. Also, it's rare that someone would suddenly gain 100lbs without a ton of eating being involved. Mostly, these things are going to make it easy to gain a pound or two here and there, or a small steady amount over time. The trouble is losing it again. That's where most of the problems are foing to cause the most interference._____

It's not uncommon to feel that way, unfortunately. For people who really think about the world from their point of view, it becomes a horrifying thought that really never goes away.

However, I can tell you that for most, their lives are simple but happy. They generally don't have the cognitive ability to know what they are missing. The few that do either focus on what they can do, or bury themselves in so much else they can't think, or turn to drugs (usually by prescription) or... well.

And Alzheimer's is horrifying to think about, but is the best defense against itself. Because the very memory problems that are destroying your life often prevent you from realizing that you are losing it. A morbid consolation prize, to be certain.

If you want to work on this, I suggest talking to someone who works with Special Olympics and maybe doing some volunteer work. I would further suggest people with Down's or Pitt-Hopkins' as the ones to be around as they are the friendliest, most easy-going, and overall happiest.

Alternately, straight up therapy to discuss this._____

I work as an in-home health aide, CNA I. I worked at a facility previously, as well.

And I was my uncle's and grandparents' caretaker.

It really, really is very different doing for family. Especially in this case, unless you have the specific training for Alzheimer's/dementia, it can be very difficult to care for someone who is deteriorating mentally. I went through that with my grandmother._____

It sucks, but it had to be done. Maybe the job itself was causing some stress illness. I had that at a previous job. Could not figure out why I was getting sick all the time when normally I only get ""stay home from work"" sick once a year.

I don't care about the sex, although I hope you are being safe.

The weed I'm also fairly ambivalent about, especially if it is legal where you are.

Dropping acid, however...

1) Incredibly dangerous. LSD is one of the most dangerous drugs on the market for a variety of reasons. It is frequently contaminated with other things. Or faked altogether. Not to mention the things you might do while tripping.

2) Unpredictable. You might get a mild trip that involves you staring at a table for 12 hours. You might experience euphoria. You might achieve ""enlightment."" Or you might have a 10+ hour nightmare that breaks your mind. There are people that have had permanent psychotic breaks from a bad trip. And once started, a bad trip doesn't stop until the drug wears off.

3) Illegal everywhere. Now, this one might be a little out of date, but I'm mostly certain LSD is not legal anywhere in the world. That's a lot of risk to get high.

4) Unhealthy. Aside from the mental effects, LSD can have detrimental physical effects as well. And that's aside from whatever you might do to yourself while high.

5) Long-term. LSD can stay in the system for decades. People that haven't taken it in decades can experience a sudden trip or flaahback.

And you are risking a college education that your parents have undoubtedly worked hard to provide the money for you to go.

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?_____You'd be surprised how much murderous intent those dementia patients carry. I've been strangled, clocked over the head with a walker, stabbed at with at least 4 different objects (pen, set of keys, butterknife, fork, and a piece of broken plastic offhand), nearly set on fire (whoever let the damn woman keep her lighter after smoking was an ass!), and had my head slammed in a doorway. I've also had my arm nearly torn off, various sprains, and a host of other injuries.

OP has expressly stated repeatedly that she isn't ditching him to rot. Just to get away from him directly, which I feel is the correct action. She has no training or ability to deal with this._____Several. I work in healthcare, for one. I have to be knowledgeable about things like that, because it affects the care the patient receives. I live in North Carolina - Duke, Wake Forest, and UNC hospitals are all around me, and I have spoken extensively to several of the doctors - leaders in the field - about exactly these types of conditions, because I often go to appointments with my clients. Furthermore, members of my family have certain of those issues, as does a close friend. I can't give you websites or books, however.

Alao, please note I'm not saying these disorders are going to affect everyone equally. It depends on people's individual biology to a great extent. Also, it's rare that someone would suddenly gain 100lbs without a ton of eating being involved. Mostly, these things are going to make it easy to gain a pound or two here and there, or a small steady amount over time. The trouble is losing it again. That's where most of the problems are foing to cause the most interference._____

It's not uncommon to feel that way, unfortunately. For people who really think about the world from their point of view, it becomes a horrifying thought that really never goes away.

However, I can tell you that for most, their lives are simple but happy. They generally don't have the cognitive ability to know what they are missing. The few that do either focus on what they can do, or bury themselves in so much else they can't think, or turn to drugs (usually by prescription) or... well.

And Alzheimer's is horrifying to think about, but is the best defense against itself. Because the very memory problems that are destroying your life often prevent you from realizing that you are losing it. A morbid consolation prize, to be certain.

If you want to work on this, I suggest talking to someone who works with Special Olympics and maybe doing some volunteer work. I would further suggest people with Down's or Pitt-Hopkins' as the ones to be around as they are the friendliest, most easy-going, and overall happiest.

Alternately, straight up therapy to discuss this._____

I work as an in-home health aide, CNA I. I worked at a facility previously, as well.

And I was my uncle's and grandparents' caretaker.

It really, really is very different doing for family. Especially in this case, unless you have the specific training for Alzheimer's/dementia, it can be very difficult to care for someone who is deteriorating mentally. I went through that with my grandmother._____

Yes, trusting someone is risky, makes you very vulnerable, but that's kind of the point, you trust she won't hurt you.

And you are right, she might, but she also might not, and I prefer be hurt a few times until I find that someone who wouldn't misuse my trust, than the other way around: be suspicious of everyone, be hurt anyway (being cheated on hurts, it doesn't matter if you find out sooner or later) and then be suspicious also of the one who wouldn't hurt me, and feeling in need to control her every move._____.

  I had already committed to helping a friend move that day, so I told her we could the day after. In retrospect I know this was wrong of me.

Wrong. I mean your assumption is wrong, you were honoring a commitment, and one day shouldn't make the difference in a years long relationship.

  ""last time you neglected your fucking family for a friend you lost them, that's on you. What if we had a kid [my name], would it take letting them die too before you smarten up?""

This was 100% over the line, but I assume you agree with me on that, since you are here asking this.

If you decide to leave her, that's perfectly OK in my opinion. She was so far over the line she couldn't see the line. 

You can, of course, decide to give her another chance, as long as you deeply discuss this issues and you get to a place where you can forgive her. If not, you will just keep this in your mind and maybe throw it at her next time you have a big enough discussion.

TL;DR: If you are able to forgive her and still love her, I think it's a good idea for you to give her a chance.

Well, you got that part wrong. I'm completely against OP's GF choice. However, it's her choice and I don't believe anyone else should have a say in that. He did speak to her, he gave her his opinion (over a dozen times), and she doesn't care.

  Similarly to it's ok to be fat so long as you accept the health risks that come along with ones own lifestyle choice.

It's ok to be fat. It's ok to be filthy. It's ok to be whatever the hell you want, as long as it's legal.

It's her damn choice. If I get a fat SO would I tell them to get fit because it's a health risk? Maybe once. Maybe a few times if the conversation comes to that. Yet I wouldn't expect them to do as I say, I would just advice them, and if it's a dealbreaker to me, I would leave.

  that doesn't make OP the asshole for simply having reasonable standards for personal hygiene

Completely agree. Only said he was TA because it's not his decision and he acts like it is._____Not that it's any of your business but I've had some relationships and a few of them were (completely or partially) actually long-distance.

You are the one who doesn't get it: in a real relationship, you need to trust your partner, specially if it's long-distance, since almost all of the info you are gonna get is from your S.O..

Your theory right now is something like ""she purposely didn't tell him her friend's friend was a guy and they had diner together, but she did tell him that his friend is trying to get him with this dude"". That's just ludicrous, if she wanted to hide one of these facts wouldn't it be the other way around?

Then again, that's completely besides the point. The point being: if you need to control what your S.O. is doing to feel secure she's not gonna cheat on you, then it's preposterous to stay in that relationship.

If she wants to cheat on you, she can do so without you ever knowing about it; so it's stupid not to trust her and still want to stay with her for some reason._____.

However, I think your friend is right; virginity is, after all, a social construct and, even if having sex with someone special is always better, there is nothing special about the first time (except maybe that it usually sucks because of the nerves and everything).

Maybe it's healthier if she just explores her sexuality the way she wants, knowing that you won't shame her for anything and with solid knowledge of safe sex (this is where ""the talk"" goes in, it's not about virginity)._____  causing stress to your partner for no real reason

That's kind of my point. Doing what you feel like doing shouldn't cause stress to your partner. And it's not ""for no real reason"", is because it's something you want to do, for whatever reason.

  how is she supposed to know if he cheats though? she won't be there.

You missed the point about trust. That's pretty much why she needs to trust him.

 Right now it may seem like her issues are her own issues.

If she's just turned 18, she skipped a grade as a kid. That's on her.
But she also chose to get animals she is responsible for, and she's trying to bring a child into that mess of a life she has. Which is unforgivable. She's not just hurting herself then. She needs an intervention.
The valedictorian thing couldn't matter less.
It's that she is an irresponsible and selfish human. Animals she can't take care of or afford, that's her being a shit person. They will suffer. Her trying trying to get knocked up by some random guy when she has perverted older men taking care of her. When that baby somes, you can bet she will mooch off your parents,  and if they're stupid. ..

Tough love because right now she's spoiled thanks to your parents refusing to make her grow up, and family allowing her to stay in their home. Enabling her.
Take the valedictorian out though. She doesn't need to be like the rest of you, as long as seen can be a decent human who isn't tanking her life and behaving recklessly. Which, she is not.

Saying the OP shouldn't give them a wake up call and try to warn them and get them to fight against the one thing that can imprison them forever is blind and ignorant. If she's ""stupid"", then give her information. Help her find time. Telling the victim that its ok to do nothing only traps them as a victim. It's how victims stay trapped in these situations. No one telling them what they can do, no one giving them options, no one telling them they can be strong in just ONE thing. And it's one tiny little thing she can be proud of. A small step.

Modeling school is a waste of time and a scam. You are trying to wake her up to her looks and personality not being right, before she destroys her chance at a future.

But she also chose to get animals she is responsible for, and she's trying to bring a child into that mess of a life she has. Which is unforgivable. She's not just hurting herself then. She needs an intervention.
The valedictorian thing couldn't matter less.
It's that she is an irresponsible and selfish human. Animals she can't take care of or afford, that's her being a shit person. They will suffer. Her trying trying to get knocked up by some random guy when she has perverted older men taking care of her. When that baby somes, you can bet she will mooch off your parents,  and if they're stupid. ..
So yes, I think she's headed down a track that should make the family write her off and tell her to get her shit together or they can't be a part of her life. Tough love because right now she's spoiled thanks to your parents refusing to make her grow up, and family allowing her to stay in their home. Enabling her.
Take the valedictorian out though. She doesn't need to be like the rest of you, as long as seen can be a decent human who isn't tanking her life and behaving recklessly. Which, she is not.
Maybe being cast out like a black sheep will force her to get her shit together. This isn't working what is happening now. _____I'm not going to attack and harass a complete stranger on the internet, because abuse didn't turn me into a bully with blind rage towards others that dare disagree with me after I attack them. This attitude displays a complete lack of awareness because it says the victim may be too ""poor"" or stupid to help themselves. Which victimizes them all over again. Saying the OP shouldn't give them a wake up call and try to warn them and get them to fight against the one thing that can imprison them forever is blind and ignorant. If she's ""stupid"", then give her information. Help her find time. Telling the victim that its ok to do nothing only traps them as a victim. It's how victims stay trapped in these situations. No one telling them what they can do, no one giving them options, no one telling them they can be strong in just ONE thing. And it's one tiny little thing she can be proud of. A small step. People who can't afford these things are given help, especially in light of these situations. It would be free. The more you know._____
Modeling school is a waste of time and a scam. You are trying to wake her up to her looks and personality not being right, before she destroys her chance at a future. Her ""teachers"" have also been blunt and honest but your parents are deluded and keeping it from her. In this case, lying will harm her._____. But judgemental? Yes.

So your sister is from the family vacation where you both wore thongs, and they roasted you for being “indecent” and she wasn’t. She calls you names and makes fun of you for being bigger than her.
Obviously you don’t want her there, but your family are hypocritical assholes so it doesn’t matter.
You made a peanut dish and explicitly TOLD her. She pretended she didn’t know so she could act like a victim. If her daughter is so allergic that being in the room with peanuts cooked can hurt her, your sister willingly put her in danger just to make you look bad. Anyone calling you an asshole missed that. Your sister is toxic and so is your family, based on your last post. You probably should include that they fat shamed you and she harasses you and they side with her. Point blank tell them you won’t host dinners. You shouldn’t have to be around someone like that._____SHP/ Is she mentally retarded? No seriously. To behave like a 3 year old...
You gave a kid a $40 fish and just threw it in a bag? With no regard for the safety of the fish? The length of time in bag? The fact that they probably don't have a tank at all, and the fish would likely die? If they did have a tank,that they probably wouldn't introduce it correctly? Even then, can you trust her to not shake or break the tank or poke it? You essentially not only gave the fish a death sentence,  but you taught a brat that if she throws a big enough fit, she can get what she wants.

That’s your child, your rules, and you know his dog has a history of unprovoked attack, and you have decided you don’t want your kids around this dog, that’s the end of the story. My SIL was attacked and has bad facial scars from a trusted family pet, my childhood best friend’s 2 year old was attacked by a friend’s dog, and is absolutely terrified by them now. Kids make unpredictable movements that may set a dog off, they reach for dog food while the dog is eating, they don’t understand touch and an animals signals to back off. In my town, a young girl was killed in our town when she was mauled by a family members pet, no one could get the dog off of her, the grandmother was stabbing the dog and screaming, and the police had to shoot and kill the dog to stop the attack. No one ever expects an attack to happen, and when they do they all say how sorry they are and etc. I’d personally rather have to apologize to them for being overprotective than them apologize to me for my child being injured. This is worth putting your foot down about IMO, and also, you’re the parent, of you trust other dogs around your kids, that’s ok, you’re probably also there to supervise. I don’t like my kids around vary many dogs if i am not there with a few exceptions._____Yta… dude!!! This is not some stray dog! Not some home crazy drug addict. This is a child! Let me talk to your wife, I want to give her the biggest hug I can find!! I am SO proud of her for remaining calm and handling the EMERGENCY situation with so much heart and kindness!!! The only thing is, I do think she should have called the police first, but man, I am so very happy that she had a hand in saving that girl!!!_____, start keeping the dogs locked away in your room, especially at mealtimes. Tell them family it is to control their new begging behavior, and stop giving people the chance to feed them because your vet specifically told you not to allow people food. It may seem cruel, but it’s easier to control the dogs than the people_____, you tried your best! Really! I know it feels really crappy. I rescued a group of puppies I saw a guy throw on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, and I’ve never felt like such an asshole. NO shelter or rescue or anything would take them. I literally couldn’t do anything with them. I found a shelter an hour away that would take them, drove them there, and the people that took them were SO rude to me, even though I told them I saw some guy throw the box they were in on the side of the road. Someone probably saw the dog there with the food bowls, and figured that he had JUST been abandoned, and took him._____. I don’t think your GF has a very accurate viewpoint. I know a severely impaired person with autism that has a pet, and they just have a connection that can’t really be described. She can be a bit violent during breakdowns, but has never hurt her pet. She respects her pets safe space (a pet carrier inside a larger cage like thing). Maybe to make yourself fee more secure, let the cat spend the night once or twice, slowly build up the amount of time cookie spends there_____Nta. You have legally protected rights. As a side note, I HATE people that have emotional support animals that are poorly trained that they just decide to take everywhere, because it ruins it for people who really need their animal. My niece is severely allergic to dogs, and has so many bad experiences with poorly trained animals that she just doesn’t go in places if she sees someone with an animal, even with a vest, because SO many people do this wrong. I appreciate them wanting to make sure that you’re not just bringing a pet to school, but it’s actually illegal, so...	care:8,fairness:2,loyalty:1,authority:2,sanctity:1_____care:3,sanctity:2,authority:1,loyalty:1_____loyalty:1,care:2,sanctity:1,authority:1_____care:2,loyalty:1,sanctity:2_____care:3,authority:1_____care:1,authority:2,fairness:1

 from her Freshman year on she dated an American boy who played Football on her College so I didn't like that at all because I wanted her to marry a good Korean guy as you may understand

No, we don't understand. That's called being racist.

 she doesn't follow his account anymore. So you'd think she finally takes me serious and would think of her family

Don't flatter yourself, this has nothing to do with you. The relationship just ran its course.

 I think that's really disgusting and I feel ashamed as a father that she does this.

Then stop looking at her account. She's an adult and you have no control over her. Posting bikini photos on Instagram is normal._____. The treatment of parents vastly differs by culture. Young people in western countries try to keep their distance from the elderly, while in the east it's expected that younger generations take care of the elderly when the time comes.

Of course your wife can't abandon her mother, but you want to spend your life as you wish.

However, your wife is a bit of a hypocrite. She wants you to put up with her mother while she makes no effort to build a relationship with yours._____ OP's mother sounds like a piece of work

No, she's not. Her husband betrayed his family, she had a right to be pissed.

A professional should be able to separate two patients and not disclose any confidential information. If the therapist couldn't do that, she should have told you.

If they're not willing to compromise at all on anything, then maybe you and your fiance should just take your own trip for a price you can afford together._____Absolutely disagree with this. OP is 17. He's not hosting, his parents are. His PS4 is in HIS room, not the shared space of the living room. OP's job is not to keep his cousin entertained with his things.

Using your daughter's deadname--even in this way--is deeply harmful to her.  You are absolutely the asshole in this situation.  Figure out how to do something about it.

Edit: Oops.  I forgot how transphobic the Reddit community is.  My bad.  Just know that lack of parental support significantly increases suicide rates among trans people.  Yes, it's his body.  Yes, it's his right to do whatever the hell he wants with it.  But also, yes, he is grievously harming his child with this and his general refusal to genuinely accept her for who she is (after only agreeing to use her name when his wife threatened divorce over it)._____.  You have my deepest sympathy, but I think you handled that situation wrong.  You had it rough as a single mom with two kids, one with autism, and I'm sure you did the best you could.  At the same time,  speaking as a parent of two children, one of whom is, like yours, insanely high maintenance / constant crisis / etc., you still have to be a parent to both children.  And when you can't do it well, as happens all too frequently when one of them is in constant crisis, you absolutely have to find a way to make it up to the other one.  And when you can't do that, you still have to make sure that they know how much you love them and how much you respect their feelings, because it truly is not fair and they are not wrong to feel that way.  So while I don't think you are an asshole, I think  in this situation because you clearly have not done a good job at making sure your daughter felt loved and respected and valued.  In the specific instance you mentioned, did the trained sitter say you couldn't leave or was that call?  If it was yours, you made the wrong decision and you need to tell your daughter that, and promise to make the right decisions in the future, and mean it.  Otherwise, I think she is right that she has suffered enough and you will continue hurting her._____.  This is a horrible position to be in and I have nothing but sympathy for everyone involved.  The behavior you describe sounds more than problematic, especially the violence toward your 4 yo.  That is not typical 8 yo behavior and the kid absolutely needs therapy.  Losing one parent is enough to explain it and now losing a second one...I can only imagine the loss that poor child is experiencing.  At the same time, you need to figure out some way to manage it and protect your other child.  I wish you the best in figuring out a positive path forward.  Just please find a way to have compassion for the child as you do so.  She is an innocent victim here, just as you are, and is too young to know how to deal with the pain she is experiencing._____, and this information belongs in the post.  The disowned you.  They do not have a daughter or a grandchild. 

And don't fool yourself.  They will be controlling.  They have already shown that they care more about their ""principles"" (or whatever justification they used for treating you so poorly) than they do about you.  They will absolutely do the same to you with respect to your child.  

In any case, if they want to reconcile, the first move is theirs.  I would perhaps consider it if they sincerely apologized, added you back into the will, and set up an irrevocable trust fund for your child equivalent to what they stopped paying to help you out._____You are willing to support your son’s college, but did not support your daughter’s.

She's incredibly selfish  (Sounds like my ex wife)  I went through the same thing, only i do work a desk job, but  i ended always putting the baby to bed, getting up at night any time the baby cried, getting up in the morning with the baby,  and work was my ""break""  too 

  

beef warrior has some great points, btw! 

  

there's 2 aspects to this though,   the possible Bi-polar behavior and that your wife is incredibly selfish.     if you want to try and stay with your wife,  you need your own therapy , so you can find that middle ground of not an ass and not a door mat.  and you will need couples therapy . 

  

Your story is the exact start of my 5 year marriage..  at this point i wish i would have gotten a divorce long ago.    when you're a push over, and your spouse is selfish , it CAN lead to all sorts of problems.  child neglect , cheating, spending a lot of money.. etc  (yep i ran into all of those) 

  

i really want to tell you to run like hell (metaphorically speaking, you should in actuality co-parent your kid 1/2 the time and live in the same city as your baby mama)  , but you should try and work things out with your wife for at least 6 months,  as you do have a child together. _____ - and thanks for sharing.    not in your case its better to not share with your mom since its going to damage what little trust you may have left in her.    guidance counselor at school maybe,  close long time friend, your dad ? 

  

\bad idea\ record yourself asking her not to share your private conversations with her, specifically mention its hurtful.     next time she shares one, post it to her face book.     she will stop, really fast.       chances are she won't have the introspection required for this to be an ""ah ha"" moment..    and instead she'll just be mad  that she looks like a bad parent publicly._____ - please don't talk to the help,  next thing you know they might feel like your equal. 

   in all seriousness ,  you are too kind hearted to have proper social etiquette in that circumstance.   they pay her to clean so they don't have to.  she's not hanging out with friends or family she's doing a job.  yes its very weird (probably not if you're used to it) but that's just how it is.  

  

kind of like if i take my car in for some work, they really don't want me to take off the tires.  even if i routinely do that at home and i feel weird standing there doing nothing._____ -  she should not be at work with pneumonia .   

all forms of  pneumonia are contagious.        even fungal based can be spread.  

  

its not as if her body spontaneously created the pneumonia.  

  

Yes there's a window where all of the bacteria (fungi, virus) is dead and the body still has its immune system working ,  extra mucus , coughing, etc.      But you really don't want to accidentally get someone sick  who has a compromised immune system, or a small child._____ -    Don't sign the birth certificate,  and technically this was rape,  because you didn't consent to unprotected sex.       you could go as far to file a police report,  which would help you a ton if she takes you to family court.    there's no way a DA is actually going to prosecute her,  so its sort of a win - win if you do file, as you'll have a police report.  

  

while its best to ignore them,  you could respond to her family and friends that call you a dead beat dad that she's a rapist.   (calling each other names is bound to fix things /Sarcasm)_____ -     yes if a good close friend of mine got injured I'd want to help and make sure they are okay, I'd go and visit.  

  

you said she has family there ,  2 weeks?   and now you need extra time?   

  

Clearly you are more in love with your Ex than your Current.  you GF  is picking up on this ,and is of course hurt.

She's incredibly selfish  (Sounds like my ex wife)  I went through the same thing, only i do work a desk job, but  i ended always putting the baby to bed, getting up at night any time the baby cried, getting up in the morning with the baby,  and work was my ""break""  too 

  

beef warrior has some great points, btw! 

  

there's 2 aspects to this though,   the possible Bi-polar behavior and that your wife is incredibly selfish.     if you want to try and stay with your wife,  you need your own therapy , so you can find that middle ground of not an ass and not a door mat.  and you will need couples therapy . 

  

Your story is the exact start of my 5 year marriage..  at this point i wish i would have gotten a divorce long ago.    when you're a push over, and your spouse is selfish , it CAN lead to all sorts of problems.  child neglect , cheating, spending a lot of money.. etc  (yep i ran into all of those) 

  

i really want to tell you to run like hell (metaphorically speaking, you should in actuality co-parent your kid 1/2 the time and live in the same city as your baby mama)  , but you should try and work things out with your wife for at least 6 months,  as you do have a child together. _____ - and thanks for sharing.    not in your case its better to not share with your mom since its going to damage what little trust you may have left in her.    guidance counselor at school maybe,  close long time friend, your dad ? 

  

\bad idea\ record yourself asking her not to share your private conversations with her, specifically mention its hurtful.     next time she shares one, post it to her face book.     she will stop, really fast.       chances are she won't have the introspection required for this to be an ""ah ha"" moment..    and instead she'll just be mad  that she looks like a bad parent publicly._____ - please don't talk to the help,  next thing you know they might feel like your equal. 

   in all seriousness ,  you are too kind hearted to have proper social etiquette in that circumstance.   they pay her to clean so they don't have to.  she's not hanging out with friends or family she's doing a job.  yes its very weird (probably not if you're used to it) but that's just how it is.  

  

kind of like if i take my car in for some work, they really don't want me to take off the tires.  even if i routinely do that at home and i feel weird standing there doing nothing._____ -  she should not be at work with pneumonia .   

all forms of  pneumonia are contagious.        even fungal based can be spread.  

  

its not as if her body spontaneously created the pneumonia.  

  

Yes there's a window where all of the bacteria (fungi, virus) is dead and the body still has its immune system working ,  extra mucus , coughing, etc.      But you really don't want to accidentally get someone sick  who has a compromised immune system, or a small child._____ -    Don't sign the birth certificate,  and technically this was rape,  because you didn't consent to unprotected sex.       you could go as far to file a police report,  which would help you a ton if she takes you to family court.    there's no way a DA is actually going to prosecute her,  so its sort of a win - win if you do file, as you'll have a police report.  

  

while its best to ignore them,  you could respond to her family and friends that call you a dead beat dad that she's a rapist.   (calling each other names is bound to fix things /Sarcasm)_____ -     yes if a good close friend of mine got injured I'd want to help and make sure they are okay, I'd go and visit.

You're GF has made up her own rule and is imposing it on others.  It's a small red flag that she won't follow social convention.

Edit: It's red flag, cause gee she's going to be fun at the company party when boss/boss's spouse expects to be called Mr./Mrs. or parent-teacher conferences.

this is a complicated situation. But be really honest with yourself - how would you deal with this if this was one of your parents?

Also, this conversation:

 A few days ago I was at a bar with my friend and discussing my true feelings about the entire situation. The bar was a little loud so I did have to speak up a little bit in order to hold the conversation. I told my friend that I’ve been feeling inundated with these bills ever since the the midpoint of the treatments, and again, although I have put on a smile and want the best for my Wife’s family, internally I wanted the financial bleeding to stop and just wanted my mother in law to die comfortably in hospice care. 

Were you diplomatic and considerate? Did you say anything that could have been misinterpreted?_____

OP, what the fuck?

 I love our life together and don't ever want to risk anything.

So why are you lying to your husband so you could go ""help"" this stupid piece of shit? You literally risked your marriage by:

 letting my boredom guide me into a making a bad choice to having a screaming match in the mall to not telling my husband what happened.

What was the point of that? Don't give time and energy to abusive assholes. To understand why, listen to the ""Dirty John"" podcast. 
_____

 everyone we know except for a few are calling him the asshole for not accepting and being pissed at her.

Seriously? Cheating is cheating, regardless of who she cheated with. 

Do you guys live in a vastly more repressive country than the US currently is or something like that? a hundred years ago I would have had a lot more sympathy for a gay person married to a straight person but in most first world countries people can either be out or just not get married..._____ or , I think. I can understand being upset that your brother stays with someone that cheats on him to this extent, but it sounds like you were seriously trashing this woman before her cheating became known:

 He got married to a woman whom I thought was a terrible match. She has two kids from previous relationships by different men. And she doesn’t work either. And she buys things on amazon constantly.

God, what horrible bitch, having kids and buying things on amazon. Your brother can marry anyone he wants, and how did you think trashing her would go? 

Now, of course, you have new information._____ IMO even if you decided to meet your needs elsewhere without her blessing, you would still not be the asshole provided you were honest about it. I'm not sure you'll be happy about the results of that decision, if you made it, but asshole isn't the word I'd use.

I do disagree with you there - knowing she's not open to an open relationship, he should divorce her before cheating. _____

It's OK to not pity someone for experiencing the consequences of their own actions. I'm not sure what he expected when he told his wife he didn't love her anymore? Divorce is generally what follows.

  But my dog always opens his mouth when someone puts even a slight bit of pressure on his teeth

   But even I have tried to take meat out of his mouth when he wasn’t supposed to eat it and by simply using a firm voice he opened his mouth.

You're missing the part when this is your dog, not hers. The dog may not listen to her the same way he listens to you. 

  So I began explaining to her how dangerous chicken bones are for dogs and that she should have done something instead of giving up.

First, it seems that she knows the danger since she tried to get the dog to spit the bone. Second, what should she do if the dog refused to open its mouth?

  I wanted to tell her she can’t walk him anymore because she can’t be trusted but I felt that I would be crossing the line with that. 

Please do this. If you're not gonna trust her and the dog won't obey her the way he obeys you, it would be better if you are the one to walk the dog._____INF.O: What was your plan if he had a life-threatening reaction?

No, I'm just kidding, . Absolutely. People like you have sent other people to the hospital on your quest to be right.

  But my dog always opens his mouth when someone puts even a slight bit of pressure on his teeth

   But even I have tried to take meat out of his mouth when he wasn’t supposed to eat it and by simply using a firm voice he opened his mouth.

You're missing the part when this is your dog, not hers. The dog may not listen to her the same way he listens to you. 

  So I began explaining to her how dangerous chicken bones are for dogs and that she should have done something instead of giving up.

First, it seems that she knows the danger since she tried to get the dog to spit the bone. Second, what should she do if the dog refused to open its mouth?

  I wanted to tell her she can’t walk him anymore because she can’t be trusted but I felt that I would be crossing the line with that. 

Please do this. If you're not gonna trust her and the dog won't obey her the way he obeys you, it would be better if you are the one to walk the dog._____INF.O: What was your plan if he had a life-threatening reaction?

No, I'm just kidding, . Absolutely. People like you have sent other people to the hospital on your quest to be right.

Really, it’s not a big deal for them to have their dream wedding without you_____, I remember that post!!! Amy is an insipid selfish self centered horrible brat. Who TF cares about this wedding? Weddings are supposed to be a time for people who love you to get together and celebrate a milestone in your life, they are meant to include everyone you love, it’s not a time to dictate every aspect of a persons appearance and life just so they can meet some “vision.” Stay home. Tell the whole family that you were not allowed to come to the celebration because of your hair. For one thing, with that much hair, a wig isn’t going to work, for another, there’s not a damn thing wrong with you and your hair the way it is! If she doesn’t want you there the way you are, she doesn’t want you there_____. Let me also say an unpopular viewpoint. Funerals are for the living. The person gone doesn’t care anymore, you go to a funeral to show the family how much you respect them and their loved one. If these people are as horrible as you say, don’t waste your money and your time. Have your own saying goodbye ceremony, and apologize that something has come up and you’re unable to go. _____. In many ways, I understand how you feel! It is your big day too, and you should have some input. However, the input should not be to kick her sister out of the wedding party. That is where you have crossed the line. You could have asked your wife if she would be willing to get a colored shawl or belt or something to help differentiate, But instead you have jumped fully on board to throwing a temper tantrum that her sister is going to be wearing a white dress at the wedding. I guess, if this is your hill to die on, it is your choice, but I would be very sad deciding not to marry somebody because of the color of the bridesmaids dress that she chose._____Nta. Man, I HATE how weddings have morphed into this fake “perfection,” thing. It’s supposed to be a celebration of love and joining together. I had a friend get married, and she had so much make up, dyed hair, extensions, and eyelashes, tape, corsets, etc that she didn’t look like herself! She dieted and lost well over 40 lbs “for the wedding.” We went to a party at her house once, and one of the ladies there thought that her husband had an portrait up of his wedding to a different woman. She asked me, “What happened to Jim’s first wife? Why does he still have their bridal portrait hanging?”_____Yta, she’s wearing the dress, but with modifications that honor her religious beliefs. You care more about “the look,” of some pictures than you do your relationships, your sisters comfort, or a persons religious beliefs. Why is your party more important than her lifestyle? It’s awfully selfish to say, “Put aside your core beliefs and values so I can have a bunch of pictures that look nice.” Especially since you’re probably going to keep these pictures forever, and display them everywhere, so her body will be on display much longer than just the few hours for your party.	care:1,fairness:3,authority:1,sanctity:1,loyalty:1_____care:2,loyalty:2,sanctity:1,authority:1_____loyalty:1,authority:1,care:2,sanctity:1_____care:2,sanctity:1,authority:1,loyalty:1_____care:1,loyalty:3,sanctity:1_____authority:1,care:2,sanctity:2

Weddings are supposed to be a time for people who love you to get together and celebrate a milestone in your life, they are meant to include everyone you love, it’s not a time to dictate every aspect of a persons appearance and life just so they can meet some “vision.” Stay home. Tell the whole family that you were not allowed to come to the celebration because of your hair.

The person gone doesn’t care anymore, you go to a funeral to show the family how much you respect them and their loved one.

Man, I HATE how weddings have morphed into this fake “perfection,” thing. It’s supposed to be a celebration of love and joining together. I had a friend get married, and she had so much make up, dyed hair, extensions, and eyelashes, tape, corsets, etc that she didn’t look like herself! She dieted and lost well over 40 lbs “for the wedding.” We went to a party at her house once, and one of the ladies there thought that her husband had an portrait up of his wedding to a different woman. She asked me, “What happened to Jim’s first wife? Why does he still have their bridal portrait hanging?”_____Yta, she’s wearing the dress, but with modifications that honor her religious beliefs. You care more about “the look,” of some pictures than you do your relationships, your sisters comfort, or a persons religious beliefs. Why is your party more important than her lifestyle? It’s awfully selfish to say, “Put aside your core beliefs and values so I can have a bunch of pictures that look nice.” Especially since you’re probably going to keep these pictures forever, and display them everywhere, so her body will be on display much longer than just the few hours for your party.	care:1,fairness:3,authority:1,sanctity:1,loyalty:1_____care:2,loyalty:2,sanctity:1,authority:1_____loyalty:1,authority:1,care:2,sanctity:1_____care:2,sanctity:1,authority:1,loyalty:1_____care:1,loyalty:3,sanctity:1_____authority:1,care:2,sanctity:2

maybe his bluetooth pairing isn't work? maybe he has ear issues or other reason not to use a head set ,  maybe he told his family ahead of time ""hey you're all on speaker in a public room""

Note to self: be civil about this asshole

I mean, you are a super asshole for cheating on her and hurting her, but I think that's obvious.

What makes me really angry is that you played the race thing when this clearly has nothing to do with it. Claims like that hurt everyone who actually is suffering for racism.

So yes, you are an asshole._____.

You cheated on her, and she didn't. As I understand you are living together but your relationship is over, right? Therefore she making up with this other guy is not of your business.

You did cheat on her, she didn't cheat on you._____.

You want sex in your relationship and she does not. It sucks that this happened to you, and specially if you still have feelings for each other, but you are trying to figure it out. That's not at all being an asshole.

She isn't an asshole either, for not wanting to have sex with you, whatever the reason.

On the other hand:

  her health insurance only covered \[the pill\] untill that age 

They are the assholes. I know that wasn't exactly the point, but why would an health insurance company decide at what age they just don't care anymore about you not wanting to get pregnant?

  

PS: did you guys went to see a doctor? This might be a health problem caused by the change in hormones, but it might also have a psychological component._____.

You have been a controlling boyfriend (even if it was with a good reason).

She has been a terrible girlfriend (no need to explain this).

  

However I don't think you are the asshole FOR LEAVING HER, that part seems fine and logical; if you want to be involved with the baby you can take a DNA test and if he/she is yours then do whatever you have or want to do for your baby. But coming back with this girl that you obviously can't be with in a healthy way would just hurt everyone._____.

I mean, her sexual orientation is her business, that's right. But you've been married for 3 years and together for 7. Unless she's discovered it herself recently (a lot of people have problems coming out, even to themselves) she probably should have mentioned it.

Not calling her an asshole because of that, tho. It's ultimately her choice if she decides to tell you or not.

Calling her TA because of this:

  she flirts with other women and sexts with them.

It would be the same that if she did that with men._____I did actually think about it, it was hard for me to decide between  or  (since in my opinion it's clear she isn't the asshole).

However I decided to go with  because he did tal to her (over a dozen times, according to him) and she obviously doesn't want to change that habit. Nevertheless he keeps bringing it up and expects her to do as he says. It's not OP's body, so in the end it's really not his decision, yet he acts and speaks as it should be.

Also, to be fair, the bit about he expecting her to shave and saying it's an indicator of ""femininity"" kinda pushed me a bit more in that direction, but the main part is still the one about: not his choice.

  Why should OP make all the sacrifices in the relationship?

And about this, he is not. He is allowed to leave. What I say is that he is not allowed to choose for her."	care:3,fairness:2_____fairness:2,loyalty:1_____loyalty:1,care:2_____care:2,authority:1_____loyalty:1,sanctity:2_____sanctity:1,loyalty:1,fairness:1

Note to self: be civil about this asshole

I mean, you are a super asshole for cheating on her and hurting her, but I think that's obvious.

What makes me really angry is that you played the race thing when this clearly has nothing to do with it. Claims like that hurt everyone who actually is suffering for racism.

So yes, you are an asshole._____.

You cheated on her, and she didn't. As I understand you are living together but your relationship is over, right? Therefore she making up with this other guy is not of your business.

You did cheat on her, she didn't cheat on you._____.

You want sex in your relationship and she does not. It sucks that this happened to you, and specially if you still have feelings for each other, but you are trying to figure it out. That's not at all being an asshole.

She isn't an asshole either, for not wanting to have sex with you, whatever the reason.

On the other hand:

  her health insurance only covered \[the pill\] untill that age 

They are the assholes. I know that wasn't exactly the point, but why would an health insurance company decide at what age they just don't care anymore about you not wanting to get pregnant?

  

PS: did you guys went to see a doctor? This might be a health problem caused by the change in hormones, but it might also have a psychological component._____.

You have been a controlling boyfriend (even if it was with a good reason).

She has been a terrible girlfriend (no need to explain this).

  

However I don't think you are the asshole FOR LEAVING HER, that part seems fine and logical; if you want to be involved with the baby you can take a DNA test and if he/she is yours then do whatever you have or want to do for your baby. But coming back with this girl that you obviously can't be with in a healthy way would just hurt everyone._____.

I mean, her sexual orientation is her business, that's right. But you've been married for 3 years and together for 7. Unless she's discovered it herself recently (a lot of people have problems coming out, even to themselves) she probably should have mentioned it.

Not calling her an asshole because of that, tho. It's ultimately her choice if she decides to tell you or not.

Calling her TA because of this:

  she flirts with other women and sexts with them.

It would be the same that if she did that with men._____I did actually think about it, it was hard for me to decide between  or  (since in my opinion it's clear she isn't the asshole).

However I decided to go with  because he did tal to her (over a dozen times, according to him) and she obviously doesn't want to change that habit. Nevertheless he keeps bringing it up and expects her to do as he says. It's not OP's body, so in the end it's really not his decision, yet he acts and speaks as it should be.

Also, to be fair, the bit about he expecting her to shave and saying it's an indicator of ""femininity"" kinda pushed me a bit more in that direction, but the main part is still the one about: not his choice.

  Why should OP make all the sacrifices in the relationship?

And about this, he is not. He is allowed to leave. What I say is that he is not allowed to choose for her."	care:3,fairness:2_____fairness:2,loyalty:1_____loyalty:1,care:2_____care:2,authority:1_____loyalty:1,sanctity:2_____sanctity:1,loyalty:1,fairness:1

 Two separate friends have reached out to me and told me I wildly overreacted and my best friend is hurt and depressed. Did I overreact? AITA?

HE ACCUSED YOU OF SEXUAL ASSAULT!!!!! No, you're not overreacting!!!

 edit - UPDATE: I have reached out to the friends accusing me of overreacting. Unsurprisingly, they have been told a wildly different side of the story, and my original instinct to keep the details private was a mistake, and backfired extraordinarily. The friend group is now fully aware of the extent and are trying to get in touch with him to remove the comment or post a retraction. A close, newer friend unrelated to this current situation is an employment/defamation lawyer who has done more for me in these past 4 hours than the alleged, hemorrhoid-ridden friend has done in the last decade. It’s safe to say I’ll be in good hands. Thank you for all your input, advice, and compassion; it has helped immensely! You might see me over at r/LegalAdvice in the coming days.

thank god and your good sense for that._____ People always tell me to be thankful I have a roof over my head and a family that cares, but life can still really suck with that.

you're right about that. I feel like ""look on the bright side, things could be worse"" is an OK thing to say to yourself (I certainly rely on it from time to time), but when you say it to other people you just sound like a huge asshole. Unless it's a really close friend that's getting a bit too self-pitying and needs a minor ass-kicking.

 Some of it was just bad decision making on my part, but a lot feels like it was out of my hands too. 

I have a lot of thoughts, lately, about the idea of control, and what we have control over as human beings. We're the only species (that we know of, so far) that can plan things out pretty far in advance, but there is an awful lot of stuff that we have absolutely no power to change about ourselves, and about the world. It's interesting._____

But only under certain circumstances. In this case, you already have a suspicion that this person is not trustworthy, and you're testing that hypothesis. In other words, you're not making up a story solely for the purpose of hurting another person or getting some kind of personal gain out of it. I judge this to be chaotic good, as long as you're careful that your made-up story doesn't have the potential to hurt anyone else.

But I do have to offer another suggestion: if you already know this person talks too much and tells everyone's business, then you have no need to do this. In cases like this a suspicion is enough - just don't tell that person anything really sensitive. 

There's also the fact that it might not work anyway - what if this person talks and spreads the story, but it just never gets back to you? that's a possibility._____

I'm really glad you told your friend, but I think you need to actively look for a professional to help you with this as well. What is your situation right now? are you in university, are you working, do you have health insurance, or do you live in a country with national health care?_____

You would never be the asshole for trying to protect a child. But as you say - this could destroy your friendship. Be prepared for the fallout._____ I told her friends she fucked him and they agreed with me, that she lowered herself.

and now you're trash talking your roommate behind her back with HER FRIENDS, and you still think you're a ""good guy"". amazing.

you're right about that.

   Almost every time a kid is bitten by a dog, its the parents fault , not the dogs.      Kids have to be taught proper interactions with dogs (no poking, pushing, not messing with their food).   Kids also need proper supervision . 

  

 I only feed my dogs in their crates with their crates shut to prevent that from happening.    So it is your wives fault, not your daughters, and not your dogs. 

  

I'm a single dad , I  have 3 kids (5,3   3)  , and 3 dogs. a rescue doberman, and 2 min pins .

  

one of my dogs (14 year old min pin) bit my 5 year old about a year ago.   my daughter was pushing the dog off her bed, he has arthritis and a bad shoulder.   my daughter yelped, no blood, wasn't even teeth marks. 

  

 This was my fault.   i failed both my dog and my daughter.  (even before this i have worked with my daughter on proper dog handling and care)  but still, my fault. 

  

I don't blame you if you want to get rid of your dog.  perfectly reasonable parenting move. 

that said, feeding your dog in its crate (door shut) would  prevent a repeat of this.  though if you go that route i'd work with a dog trainer.   according to the dog whisperer you should be able to take your dogs food away with out them growling or biting...  \shrugs\  i'm no expert,  I've only  read a few books._____    if you owned the dog on paper you should have been the one to keep it.   but a dog having a back yard versus walks on concrete  , really the back yard is a better quality of life for a day, and lastly  its a dog not a child.       I could take your dog and in a few weeks the dog wouldn't care , its not going to be emotionally scarred for its meager 12 years of existence.   

  

you had your dog with your boy friend for 2 years  1 year ago (3 years)  so 25-30% of its entire life span is already gone.      you should have just rescued a dog locally in NYC. 

  

sorry if my matter of fact is coming across as callous but ,  I'm divorced with 3 kids , actual human beings whose formative years are longer than a dogs lifespan.    I also own 2 rescue dogs (my ex took 1 ) .    While i love my dogs, and i'll cry over them , when they pass.  they aren't human beings.     if someone took my 8 year old min pin and treated him really nicely he would get over it. 

  

i know this cause a close friend of mine watched him for 8 days when my twins were born.   he howled / looked for me for a few days, then just settled into a new routine at a new house and appeared to be adjusting .  sure he was really happy to see me again.   but its nothing like what my kids go through during custody changes . _____ -   you can take PTO for any reason,  Personal time off,   you didn't take grievance time off,  or hours of a shared pool for cancer patients.  

  

I can see both sides of the ""its just a cat""   too.   not everyone gets as attached to animals,  or to specific animals.   I cried when my cat died, but not my fish, nor my Eel.   Ex cried over the eel dying.  \shrugs\     how ever,  your co-worker was an A for being callous about your suffering.   he can think its just a cat, but he should keep that opinion to himself. 

  

if your attached and empathize with a particular animal then its death will make you cry._____ -        but that's not going to be great on your relationship with your wife. 

who handles resentment better?   that's the person who should ""lose"" on this one for the betterment of your relationship

funerals aren't for the dead, they are for the living,  primary think of this funeral is for your GF .   even for the religious a funeral is to help the living grieve .  which is part of the healing process , dealing with such a loss, and moving forward in her life. 

&amp;#x200B;

its not like they were gonna require you to renounce Christ or anything.   you should have been there to support your GF in her greatest moment of grief, agony, loneliness  and despair.

if you love her apologize for your selfishness and short nearsightedness.

   Almost every time a kid is bitten by a dog, its the parents fault , not the dogs.      Kids have to be taught proper interactions with dogs (no poking, pushing, not messing with their food).   Kids also need proper supervision . 

  

 I only feed my dogs in their crates with their crates shut to prevent that from happening.    So it is your wives fault, not your daughters, and not your dogs. 

  

I'm a single dad , I  have 3 kids (5,3   3)  , and 3 dogs. a rescue doberman, and 2 min pins .

  

one of my dogs (14 year old min pin) bit my 5 year old about a year ago.   my daughter was pushing the dog off her bed, he has arthritis and a bad shoulder.   my daughter yelped, no blood, wasn't even teeth marks. 

  

 This was my fault.   i failed both my dog and my daughter.  (even before this i have worked with my daughter on proper dog handling and care)  but still, my fault. 

  

I don't blame you if you want to get rid of your dog.  perfectly reasonable parenting move. 

that said, feeding your dog in its crate (door shut) would  prevent a repeat of this.  though if you go that route i'd work with a dog trainer.   according to the dog whisperer you should be able to take your dogs food away with out them growling or biting...  \shrugs\  i'm no expert,  I've only  read a few books._____    if you owned the dog on paper you should have been the one to keep it.   but a dog having a back yard versus walks on concrete  , really the back yard is a better quality of life for a day, and lastly  its a dog not a child.       I could take your dog and in a few weeks the dog wouldn't care , its not going to be emotionally scarred for its meager 12 years of existence.   

  

you had your dog with your boy friend for 2 years  1 year ago (3 years)  so 25-30% of its entire life span is already gone.      you should have just rescued a dog locally in NYC. 

  

sorry if my matter of fact is coming across as callous but ,  I'm divorced with 3 kids , actual human beings whose formative years are longer than a dogs lifespan.    I also own 2 rescue dogs (my ex took 1 ) .    While i love my dogs, and i'll cry over them , when they pass.  they aren't human beings.     if someone took my 8 year old min pin and treated him really nicely he would get over it. 

  

i know this cause a close friend of mine watched him for 8 days when my twins were born.   he howled / looked for me for a few days, then just settled into a new routine at a new house and appeared to be adjusting .  sure he was really happy to see me again.   but its nothing like what my kids go through during custody changes . _____ -   you can take PTO for any reason,  Personal time off,   you didn't take grievance time off,  or hours of a shared pool for cancer patients.  

  

I can see both sides of the ""its just a cat""   too.   not everyone gets as attached to animals,  or to specific animals.   I cried when my cat died, but not my fish, nor my Eel.   Ex cried over the eel dying.  \shrugs\     how ever,  your co-worker was an A for being callous about your suffering.   he can think its just a cat, but he should keep that opinion to himself. 

  

if your attached and empathize with a particular animal then its death will make you cry._____ -        but that's not going to be great on your relationship with your wife. 

who handles resentment better?   that's the person who should ""lose"" on this one for the betterment of your relationship 

   i have 3 dogs (1 rescue)  and 3 kids   I love them all a lot, but people   animals

4)""i fear for my daughter""....so i'm going to make demands of my ADULT daughter and if she does not comply i will throw her onto the street where she would be infinitely more unsafe and more prone to fall into drugs. i'm a genius i tells ya!! 

thank goodness she has a father in the picture who actually cares about her safety. the fact both those people are telling you that you are acting crazy should tell you something. given that it was both of their first reactions i get the impression this isn't the first you've had a monumental over reaction._____!! loves the game?? no, NO. she's addicted to the game and it's harming her life. trying to take off work to play, not wanting to participate in family things with you, pouting like a child and ignoring everyone cause she had to adult things, immediately running to the game, crying and screaming cause something didn't work, leaving you because she had to act like an adult....these are addicts behaviours. no even keeled, rational thoughted person acts like this over having to postpone their game for a few hours. she needs therapy and a quick trip back to reality._____!! do not ask your daughter to not be herself just because her grandparents don't get it or even try to. that's not fair to your daughter. she shouldn't have appease old people who refuse to get with the decade. asking her to do so just makes the dysphoria worse. i get that you love your parents cause they are you parents but if they can not respect her for who she is and treat her well you should not be having them around her, at all. you're suppose to be on her side and part of being on her side is protecting her from bigots."	fairness:1,sanctity:2,authority:4,care:2_____care:5,authority:1,loyalty:2,fairness:1_____care:5,authority:1,sanctity:2_____authority:3,care:4,sanctity:1_____sanctity:2,care:4,loyalty:1_____care:2,authority:3,fairness:2

1. She agreed with you last year and said you wouldn't go if they only punished you.

2. All the other couples, even ones younger than you and not together as long shared tents. 

So she went back on her word. She said it was share a tent or you two don't go. Now she's trying to force you to deal with the same bullshit that happened last year.

It would be one thing if other couples weren't sharing. This is hypocritical. 

And incredibly,  she wants you to suck it up and have a miserable time,  and she refuses to let you talk to her family. She wants you to go on a trip with them, but you can't talk to them. 

Sorry but she's acting like an unreasonable brat. I'd tell her she has 3 choices. 

1. You talk to them.

2. She talks to them.

3. You don't go.

There is no scenario where I would let her guilt and bully me into going when I had a horrible time and was treated unfairly.

Reading comprehension. The problem isn’t“slut-shaming” no matter how eager people are to jump on that bandwagon with pitchforks in hand. You stopped inviting her partially because she’s always busy with other guys. But the problem isn’t that she is promiscuous. The problem is that she’s not being safe and she’s upset that the guys she’s sleeping with in hookup capacity, don’t want more than a hookup. She is getting hurt and upset because she’s hooking up with guys and not understanding the concept of casual sex. She’s also being so unsafe that she is having sex with guys she hardly knows without being safe. She almost got pregnant. She’s putting herself at risk for STDs. She’s destroying her self esteem because she wants to be treated as more than a hookup by her hookups. She’s hurting by herself. By all means, enjoy casual sex,  but be safe and accept it for what it is._____
You cannot hide something this big from your girlfriend, something that still bothers you to this day. Can you hide it for 20 years?
Pacifist or not, she needs to understand that war means self defense and protecting yourself. She cannot fault you for protecting your life.
Sit her down and tell her. Now. Tell her that you didn't want to ruin dinner, but there are some dark things you saw in war that not things you like to think about normally. Be honest. The longer you hide it,  the worse it will get. Trust me._____
Text her friends back that if you are an asshole for not being OK with cheating and her telling you she loved her ex, then you are glad to be an asshole.
What a shit therapist to send her back to the guy who was emotionally abusing her. But I guess if she hadn't,  you wouldn't know what a trash person she is. When a person flirts with you and has the nerve to even hug or kiss you on the cheek when you are taken, it's disrepectful not to end it immediately. _____. Sorry I had to stop reading early into her using you and eroding your self respect. 
Red flags are when someone is willing to flirt when they are taken. (Also, you got really cheated on because your gf never trusted you after she caught you crossing lines)
 because she was abusive manipulative trash. You knew it, and went back again and again which lacks common sense, but you were smart enough to eventually GTFO._____
She has issues with them constantly hurting her feelings. Which sounds like it means she frequently vents that she’s hurt and upset. She is isn’t being careful, which is just foolish as far as STDs.
You stopped inviting her because she never spends time with you and you’ve become annoyed with her sleeping with guys and then getting upset they’re using her. 
That’s not “slut shaming”, it’s talking to her about a problem she’s creating for herself. Diseases, pregnancy, and being used. It would be one thing if she was promiscuous and never mentioned how upset she was by how they use her and she was being careful and responsible.

test	telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a SAHM I am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore	"YTA.  Being a SAHM is a full time job.  Watching children is a massive job in itself.  If you're going to be lazy on top of cutting the housekeeper and the nanny entirely, your wife is going to be working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  You get a break from your kids.  You get to interact with other adults.  Being a SAHM is worth a housekeeper, a personal chef, a nanny, a driver, and so much more._____He's still an adult and should pick up at home.

  I mostly agree with you.    I'm a divorced dad of 3 (5,3&amp;3)  and i have my kids 2/3 of the time.   I work 40 hours a week, commute about 12 hrs , and do everything myself.   i was also laid off for a while and had the kids home with me full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

If my options were be home with the kids or work. i'd pick the kids .  esp once they start school, lol. 

but sounds like your wording was not very good.   and its likely your reddit post was a slightly better of the wording you used.   

&amp;#x200B;

Change it up to what you can do before your breaking point..  you can work 60-80 hours a week,   and you can help out with meals , dishes, putting kids to bed , yard work, trash, etc.    and once a month clean out some bathrooms.   laundry on weekends  (or what ever your breaking point is)  

&amp;#x200B;

then see what her breaking point is with her job

and what her breaking point is with home chores 

&amp;#x200B;

ask which she would rather do, and see if you can pick up what's gonna break her, and vice versa.     Maybe you can handle diapers, picking up toys, and running the vacuum after work but you don't want to go near a kicthen,    or maybe you don't mind cooking and dishes but you'll hate picking up toys.

What were the stakes for the Indians who were being occupied by the British. 


Millions died, millions more suffered and they went from having 27% of the GDP to a non player. 

Versus LBGT rights in america.    yes hundreds have died,  and thousands have been attacked just for being born that way.   

but millions is higher than thousands. 

Every death is bad, yes i care more for my contemporary counterparts than those who i read about in history books. and i care more for american lives than foreign lives.   Still the hundreds versus millions . 

are you trying to say that  the LGBT community has it worse now, than Indians did under British rule?   Cause that i'd disagree with. 

At Any rate.  I'll try changing hearts and minds through polite discourse , and you are free to try any method you want (short of violence - that i won't condone)   I just don't agree that the most flagrant / NSFW public displays are going to help with the ""remaining hold outs""  so to say .. 

 Courteous requests will get you no where,  it wasn't their willingness to walk in a parade naked or with sex toys strapped to them that got things changing. 

  

there's a great podcast on stonewall in Stuff you should know. 

  

Honestly what did the most for gay rights was gays in television   movies, slowly normalizing it to the masses who eventually started voting in favor of gay rights , to the point that the movement has achieved critical momentum. 

  

you're conflating something that has happened,  with what was effective. 

  

like when there's a bee in my car, and i'm waiving my arms around all crazy, saying ""please leave me alone""    but its me rolling down my window that actually got the bee to leave,  not my whinging. :)_____you're not entirely wrong.  and i'm sure there's been some trickle down effects.   someone in the closet might see someone in a pride parade naked and wearing sex toys and decide they can come out to their friends and family, and that person changes minds of straight people. 

Well i'd like the LBGT community to have less violence targeted at them. 
which will only be achieved by changing hearts and minds. 

what happened when we give up on changing hearts and minds?   you end up with the charolettesville march .  

For a long time i just figured racism was just about done and why should i care about changing their minds?   none of my friends are racist,  , and hey They are wrong.   

Well that sort of thinking allows hate to fester, and festering hate leads to violence, and death.  

at least , IMO, that's why we should ALL care about changing as many minds as possible._____Not every unpopular or wrong idea is hate speech.

  

Hate speech is really ""we hate this group of people, and they should suffer violence""

  

Atheists may think i'm delusional (mental condition) for believing in God, but i wouldn't qualify that as hate speech, unless the up to to ""you're delusional, and because of that, we are going to hurt you""

  

sounds like his brother is going on that ""gender dispohria ?""  rant .  but if he's the ""lets get you help"" type .. that's really not hate speech.   its a lot more of mis-guided love speech.

  

which is often worse... people who think they are acting out of ""social good"" are relentless ...  just like tagging opinions you disagree with as hate speech.    its cause you care about society right? _____well then we are gonna disagree until the end of time.  :)  and that's okay,  maybe it's a good thing.    Corporations care about limiting liability and public image.   

Look at the CNN leaked tape of Amy robach on a hot mic explaining how she had an Estein story for 3 years, with victim testimony.   It got squashed because they feared upsetting people in power.  and CNN put out an update that they would be looking for the person who leaked that tape , to fire them. 

that's not the right thing, but it limits their liability. 

my definition of racism is hating an other ethnic group, or believing they are inferior / you are superior.  

outside of that, you're not racist.   you may do something that is racially or culturally insensitive, and at times they look the same,  but its not. 

I know there's been a push on some colleges to say that racism is anything that makes a minority feel uncomfortable.   Did i hold open a door for someone 10 seconds behind me?  but not the person 60 seconds behind me?     oh that 2nd person was a different ethnicity than me, RACISM!!!   but no.   or  prejudice + power = racism.      even if i have no power, i'm a racist under that theory because i'm white and i prejudge blacks as not getting a sun burn as quickly as me.   

shrugs  I don't care that the correct nuanced view is so difficult for people to grasp that they don't get it.  its still the correct answer. 

and yes with out any other info, i would guess he was racist,  but that's a GUESS.    charolettes ville march was racist, because they were exposing views of that they felt they were superior to others. 

But say lots of Dave Chapelle's stand up  is racially insensitive, but not racist, because he's joking. 

if you think the OP's class clown was racist, reguardless of what is in his heart, then you also have to think dave chappelle is racist , or you are a hypocrite.   which is fine, people come in all sorts of flavors._____ -   he's trying to ask ""what's your ethnicity"" but doesn't know the proper wording.

\shrugs\ my mom does a lot of work for charity, and gives a lot of money to charities.   all sorts of charities for peoples of all many different countries.    but she will say the term wet back.    esp with the amount of hispanic friends i have its so cringe.    she's not hateful, she doesn't feel any other ethnicity is inferior or any of that hot garbage.  but she still says that...   

  

some non hateful people literally get stuck in their ways.   if you know them, and know they aren't actually racist, (but maybe do some things that are racially insensitive)    cut them some slack, while continually reminding them of the correct way.

  I mostly agree with you.    I'm a divorced dad of 3 (5,3&amp;3)  and i have my kids 2/3 of the time.   I work 40 hours a week, commute about 12 hrs , and do everything myself.   i was also laid off for a while and had the kids home with me full time.

Change it up to what you can do before your breaking point..  you can work 60-80 hours a week,   and you can help out with meals , dishes, putting kids to bed , yard work, trash, etc.    and once a month clean out some bathrooms.   laundry on weekends  (or what ever your breaking point is)  

&amp;#x200B;

then see what her breaking point is with her job

and what her breaking point is with home chores 

&amp;#x200B;

ask which she would rather do, and see if you can pick up what's gonna break her, and vice versa.     Maybe you can handle diapers, picking up toys, and running the vacuum after work but you don't want to go near a kicthen,    or maybe you don't mind cooking and dishes but you'll hate picking up toys.

What were the stakes for the Indians who were being occupied by the British. 


Millions died, millions more suffered and they went from having 27% of the GDP to a non player. 

Versus LBGT rights in america.    yes hundreds have died,  and thousands have been attacked just for being born that way.   

but millions is higher than thousands. 

Every death is bad, yes i care more for my contemporary counterparts than those who i read about in history books. and i care more for american lives than foreign lives.   Still the hundreds versus millions . 

are you trying to say that  the LGBT community has it worse now, than Indians did under British rule?   Cause that i'd disagree with. 

At Any rate.  I'll try changing hearts and minds through polite discourse , and you are free to try any method you want (short of violence - that i won't condone)   I just don't agree that the most flagrant / NSFW public displays are going to help with the ""remaining hold outs""  so to say .. 

 Courteous requests will get you no where,  it wasn't their willingness to walk in a parade naked or with sex toys strapped to them that got things changing. 

  

there's a great podcast on stonewall in Stuff you should know. 

  

Honestly what did the most for gay rights was gays in television   movies, slowly normalizing it to the masses who eventually started voting in favor of gay rights , to the point that the movement has achieved critical momentum. 

  

you're conflating something that has happened,  with what was effective.

Well i'd like the LBGT community to have less violence targeted at them. 
which will only be achieved by changing hearts and minds. 

what happened when we give up on changing hearts and minds?   you end up with the charolettesville march .  

For a long time i just figured racism was just about done and why should i care about changing their minds?   none of my friends are racist,  , and hey They are wrong.   

Well that sort of thinking allows hate to fester, and festering hate leads to violence, and death.  

at least , IMO, that's why we should ALL care about changing as many minds as possible._____Not every unpopular or wrong idea is hate speech.

  

Hate speech is really ""we hate this group of people, and they should suffer violence""

  

Atheists may think i'm delusional (mental condition) for believing in God, but i wouldn't qualify that as hate speech, unless the up to to ""you're delusional, and because of that, we are going to hurt you""

  

sounds like his brother is going on that ""gender dispohria ?""  rant .  but if he's the ""lets get you help"" type .. that's really not hate speech.   its a lot more of mis-guided love speech.

  

which is often worse... people who think they are acting out of ""social good"" are relentless ...  just like tagging opinions you disagree with as hate speech.    its cause you care about society right? _____well then we are gonna disagree until the end of time.  :)  and that's okay,  maybe it's a good thing.    Corporations care about limiting liability and public image.   

Look at the CNN leaked tape of Amy robach on a hot mic explaining how she had an Estein story for 3 years, with victim testimony.   It got squashed because they feared upsetting people in power.  and CNN put out an update that they would be looking for the person who leaked that tape , to fire them. 

that's not the right thing, but it limits their liability. 

my definition of racism is hating an other ethnic group, or believing they are inferior / you are superior.  

outside of that, you're not racist.   you may do something that is racially or culturally insensitive, and at times they look the same,  but its not.

outside of that, you're not racist.   you may do something that is racially or culturally insensitive, and at times they look the same,  but its not. 

I know there's been a push on some colleges to say that racism is anything that makes a minority feel uncomfortable.   Did i hold open a door for someone 10 seconds behind me?  but not the person 60 seconds behind me?     oh that 2nd person was a different ethnicity than me, RACISM!!!   but no.   or  prejudice + power = racism.      even if i have no power, i'm a racist under that theory because i'm white and i prejudge blacks as not getting a sun burn as quickly as me.   

shrugs  I don't care that the correct nuanced view is so difficult for people to grasp that they don't get it.  its still the correct answer. 

and yes with out any other info, i would guess he was racist,  but that's a GUESS.    charolettes ville march was racist, because they were exposing views of that they felt they were superior to others. 

But say lots of Dave Chapelle's stand up  is racially insensitive, but not racist, because he's joking. 

if you think the OP's class clown was racist, reguardless of what is in his heart, then you also have to think dave chappelle is racist , or you are a hypocrite.   which is fine, people come in all sorts of flavors._____ -   he's trying to ask ""what's your ethnicity"" but doesn't know the proper wording.     Or maybe he thinks he's being funny. 

  

\shrugs\ my mom does a lot of work for charity, and gives a lot of money to charities.   all sorts of charities for peoples of all many different countries.    but she will say the term wet back.    esp with the amount of hispanic friends i have its so cringe.    she's not hateful, she doesn't feel any other ethnicity is inferior or any of that hot garbage.  but she still says that...   

  

some non hateful people literally get stuck in their ways.   if you know them, and know they aren't actually racist, (but maybe do some things that are racially insensitive)    cut them some slack, while continually reminding them of the correct way. 

  

So in your case,   treat him like a toddler and rephrase his question.   or answer as worded, then rephrase?

""what are you?""

""a bit tired, but hopeful,  are you trying to ask my ethnicity?  I'm half Peruvian and half Ecuadorian""   like my little kids, he should pick it up sooner or later._____ -      While those Apples are tainted fruit from the tree of a racist,  the only thing that can purify the unfortunate apples is to pass through the holy fire of a non racists digestive track.     not all of us can be that hero, but thankfully you are there for us.    Please  put as many apples as you can into the soul fire that is your stomach acid.

1)sometimes shit happens, literally. it has nothing to do with age or being adult(if it did incontinence wouldn't be a thing that happens to anyone). when the body says go it's not just going to sit around a wait for you to get where you need to be. 

2)most people do not throw out clothes just because they get soiled. soap and water is a thing that exists and clothes are fucking expensive. 

3)THE WASHING MACHINE CLEANS ITSELF AS IT IS USED!!! there is not going to be chunks of poop just hanging out in there. it is already clean. i mean, do you double wash after doing sheets or your undies every time?? they literally sit right against your asshole all day/during sleep where poop particles could get on them. if you're worried about contamination live like bubble boy cause poop particles are everywhere.

please don't have kids. you won't survive it if you can't handle this one time event._____!! since you are 1/3rd of the people in the house you should be doing a 1/3rd of the household chores. i highly doubt daily dishes and mopping, vacuuming and recycling once a week is 1/3rd of all chores. and this, 

 the floor is a mess needs moping but we have people working on the house every day and it gets muddy again so why bother.

test	telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a SAHM I am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore	"I have a cleaning company, some of our clients are ""don't lift a finger"" excutives. it takes 9 hours a week (not including cooking and shopping) for laundry, tidying and cleaning up after 1.5 adults (think occasional GF overnight/friend came in for a shower after golf to change to go to show) 3000sq  2.5 bath home that virtually zero cooking is done in.  And that's someone who is not watching kids at the same time.  But yeah those houses are really clean.  

With toddlers its way more laundry and way way more picking up.  think 2 hours a day 7 days a week plus 5 hours a week for the bigger stuff you only do once a week plus 5 hours a month for the really big stuff.  And that doesn't count cooking and is if you were not caring for 2 childeren while doing it. _____NAH but I still think you're wrong.  

2 context points..

if the plan is realistically she stays home till the kids are in full-time school and past the age of room moms. She will be working every waking hour for 7 years then go back to full-time work + half the chores.  I'm bringing this up because pre-70s when a housewife was much more common those SAHMs got to stay home the whole time. So while mom may had had 5 rough years (until they could say watch your brother while I have a shower/go play outside) they also got 45 more years of not working outside of the home at least not as a breadwinner under financial pressure.  BTW lots of those upper middle case SAHM of the 50s and 60s had housekeepers too. 

point 2 

Those moms had more SAHMs to network with, their neighbors, sisters, others, and aunts stayed at home moms too.    Oh and Dad's were still expected to help with homework, take the kids for ice cream or teach them to fish or ride a bike and discipline. and don't forget about home repairs and lawn care, banking, he might have even done the grocery shopping cause he was the one who drove etc. and take mom out for date night and BBQ and probably an inside chore or 2 like drying the dishes or have a vegetable garden.  I'm saying you can't just cherry pick one aspect of that lifestyle and call it good.     So you're ""I work that will be my only contribution"" is a ""never was"" fantasy.   

So I don't think you're an asshole but I do think you're wrong, yeah she should do more around the house but it never should be ""you do everything.""

The context that is virtually impossible to gauge without knowing you does matter a lot. If you have been saying ""Were exclusive but casually dating"" VS  planning vague shit years down the line, ""We should go to Paris one day maybe after we graduate and have been working a few years"" 

There is a huge difference between:

I like you and have no clue whether I'd want to marry you at some point in the future. 

I really love them but there is an issue I hope they fix that so we can get married. 

I have no intention of marrying anyone and am clear about that.

I want to get married someday and I am 95%+ sure I don't want to marry you specifically.  But they are fun for now, when we graduate/when I met someone better I'll break up with her. 

The asshole comes from the not being clear she failed ""the interview"" that she reasonably thinks is still a mutual interview.  This is gender biased but in my personal observation men are much more likely than women to continue dating after they firmly decide ""She is definitely not for me"" That included first date ""eww I hate this chick but she seems willing to sleep with me, I'll sleep with her and just not call her back""  because of that women incorrectly conclude ""we're still dating = this relationship is progressing"" _____ but don't tell her off because it won't be effective and it may even encourage her to be more toxic.  People have the idea that toxic are master manipulators and think that means they plan everything; In my experience, they don't plan anything its more they have unconsciously leanred ""it feels good to make up after a fight""  so when they feel bad they start a fight, they don't know why they are starting a fight.  The behavior it instinct and emotion-based and geared for instant gratification and remember that gratification will very likely not be at all healthy.  It's frequently things like ""they're very upset AHHHH they still love me/I still control them/I'm better then them/Now they will talk to me (even if it's yelling, yelling is more gratifying then silence), etc.  so sending an email/letter is ""the fix"" they are seeking by acting inapporpiatly don't comply._____So you are a human rapist detector more so then your GF who I can almost guarantee you has been practicing this her whole adult life. 

And just as a postscript if I was assaulted and my BF wanted to met male coworkers to protect me because BF thought they might pick up on body language I missed...I might hear ""it was your fault you were assaulted because you miss body language."" I might wonder if you doubted me I might think you have no fucking clue.  _____ you escalated way too far.  She was may have asked your parents, but they are the ones who agreed to not to loan you the money for her sake ($3500 ish US if I did the conversion right) 

In a gossipy group, people would have forgotten ""borrowed money"" real fast and are smart enough to figure out you're doing OK on their own eventually.  BUT people don't forget a major moral taboo. And if I understand the culture you also did major social damage to your parents and other siblings oh and yourself.  

You brought a nuke to a slap fight. People love juicy gossip but the smart ones will never trust you. _____And I mean the accusation wasn't that clear , ""I have gut feeling"", ""I am uncomfortable about your relationship with your soon to be SIL"" might mean I think you're sleeping together or you obviuosly have undisclosed feeling towards her (and come on we have all seen someone in love with their friends or relatives wife/GF), you're rude to her, or you treat her with way more respect then you give me, you're nicer to her, etc.  I mean from the way it reads ""Mt gf just broke up with me because of our relationship"" what haha she's just jealous my GF is prettier and more successful"" and  ""yeah she is banned from my life""  OP and her fiancee sound super supportive. 

For example, I had a friend with a GF who was just mean as honey badger but he had a sarcastic bitty sense of humor, so he took a lot of the really mean things she said as jokes.  ""yeah I suck for buying you flowers and not letting the plant just live their lives in the park haha""  once he saw he interacting with people she respected more it was ""oh shit you mean all that stupid mean BS, fuck you I'm out""_____Because maybe she didn't fire OP for exposing her child to a psycho killer/child molester but because OP decided to invite her BF to hang out while she was babysitting. 

And she jumped to ""Did you invite him"" cause that's a very very VERY common issue with babysitters, haven't you ever seen a horror movie (in that case the troupe is based on the reality that babysitters someone invite their BF/GF friends over when there are no adults O)"	care:1,fairness:1,sanctity:3,authority:1,loyalty:1_____care:3,authority:3_____care:3,authority:1,sanctity:1_____care:3,fairness:1,loyalty:1_____care:1,authority:2,loyalty:2_____care:3,loyalty:1,sanctity:1

With toddlers its way more laundry and way way more picking up.  think 2 hours a day 7 days a week plus 5 hours a week for the bigger stuff you only do once a week plus 5 hours a month for the really big stuff.  And that doesn't count cooking and is if you were not caring for 2 childeren while doing it. _____NAH but I still think you're wrong.  

2 context points..

if the plan is realistically she stays home till the kids are in full-time school and past the age of room moms. She will be working every waking hour for 7 years then go back to full-time work + half the chores.  I'm bringing this up because pre-70s when a housewife was much more common those SAHMs got to stay home the whole time. So while mom may had had 5 rough years (until they could say watch your brother while I have a shower/go play outside) they also got 45 more years of not working outside of the home at least not as a breadwinner under financial pressure.  BTW lots of those upper middle case SAHM of the 50s and 60s had housekeepers too. 

point 2 

Those moms had more SAHMs to network with, their neighbors, sisters, others, and aunts stayed at home moms too.    Oh and Dad's were still expected to help with homework, take the kids for ice cream or teach them to fish or ride a bike and discipline. and don't forget about home repairs and lawn care, banking, he might have even done the grocery shopping cause he was the one who drove etc. and take mom out for date night and BBQ and probably an inside chore or 2 like drying the dishes or have a vegetable garden.

&gt;I told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. 

Really? I thought the purpose was for her to be home with your children, not to become your full time maid. 

And if you deserve a break after being at work for so many hours - knowing that she is at home watching the kids the entire time you're at work - when does she get her break? She's expected to just be on duty 24/7 with no help from you because you work outside the home? Or will you graciously watch the kids when you get home, so that she can start her second job as maid?

Not saying this is always true, but it's definitely been the case in my life. The closest I ever got to a physical fight at school was with someone much larger, and I was pretty positive I would lose. They wanted to do that ""meet me after school"" bs, and I said ""No, if you want to fight, let's do it right here, right now. And you'll probably win, but I'm going to fucking hurt you before I go down."" 

Suddenly they lost all interest in fighting me, just shut the fuck up and walked away, never troubled me again. _____ except maybe to yourself =(

 My role in the friend group is the backbone, the person who keeps you grounded and listen to everybody's problems. I've never been the one to truly talk about my depression openly

 I drag my ass out of it and tell my self to stop being a bitch. The world doesn't owe you anything and it could be a lot worse.

Friendship is a two-way street, you deserve the same support you give your friends. And it doesn't sound like they refuse to give it, but like you refuse to open up about needing it. 

Even ""the strong one"" needs someone to lean on from time to time, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it and it doesn't make you a bitch or a pussy or any of those mean things you say to yourself. Being vulnerable is fucking HARD, it takes guts, especially if you're the type who tends to keep things to yourself. 

I get what you're saying about not wanting to drown in self pity, and it's good to keep things in perspective and know it could be worse - but just because it could be worse, or because someone else has it worse, that doesn't negate your right to feel sad/upset/whatever the fuck you want about your own situation. 

_____ - if one of my friends made a pass at my SO and they didn't tell me, I'd be really pissed. Mostly at the friend, obviously, but also at my SO for hiding this type of betrayal from me. Anyone who would try to hit on my SO behind my back is clearly not a real friend, and I feel like I have a right to know that. 

I would be very hurt to find out that not only has my friend betrayed me, but the person I'm in a relationship with than kept it from me so I ""wouldn't get upset"".

“It takes your enemy and your friend, working together, to hurt you to the heart: the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you.”_____Ask for help when you need it. ""For no one can fill those of your needs that you won't let show."" -Lean On Me

If you're choosing to ""muddle through"" and refusing to ask for help, how are your friends supposed to know it? In their eyes, this is the first time you've needed help that they couldn't be there for, so they've done nothing wrong. 

Don't go the opposite way now and ask that they meet your EVERY need, definitely be as self-sufficient as possible. But I'm sure your friends wouldn't mind helping you out more if you give them more than a day's notice. 

Grocery pickup is a thing most places, you can ask a friend what day they'd be available to give you a ride and then schedule your grocery pickup for that day. (I know your post was about the pharmacy but in a comment you mentioned eating bread for days rather than asking for help). Having a pickup order ready would make it a lot easier to get a ride, because then it's just to pickup the groceries and you're not expecting anyone to wait while you shop._____If she's not comfortable with you hanging out with this friend, you asking her to join you is a fair compromise. Her refusing to even give that a chance is really unfair.

Follow up question - when you offer to hang out with this other friend and your gf, are you talking just the three of you, or part of a larger group? If it's the former, I guess I could kinda understand your gf not wanting to feel like a third wheel to you and your friend (which can definitely happen without you intending it).

test	telling my husband that when/if he quits his job to be a SAHD I am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore	"YTA

&gt;I told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. 

Really? I thought the purpose was for her to be home with your children, not to become your full time maid. 

And if you deserve a break after being at work for so many hours - knowing that she is at home watching the kids the entire time you're at work - when does she get her break? She's expected to just be on duty 24/7 with no help from you because you work outside the home? Or will you graciously watch the kids when you get home, so that she can start her second job as maid?

 I drag my ass out of it and tell my self to stop being a bitch. The world doesn't owe you anything and it could be a lot worse.

Friendship is a two-way street, you deserve the same support you give your friends. And it doesn't sound like they refuse to give it, but like you refuse to open up about needing it. 

Even ""the strong one"" needs someone to lean on from time to time, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it and it doesn't make you a bitch or a pussy or any of those mean things you say to yourself. Being vulnerable is fucking HARD, it takes guts, especially if you're the type who tends to keep things to yourself. 

I get what you're saying about not wanting to drown in self pity, and it's good to keep things in perspective and know it could be worse - but just because it could be worse, or because someone else has it worse, that doesn't negate your right to feel sad/upset/whatever the fuck you want about your own situation.
