I get customers who are upset about this or that, and they tell me, in a huff, ""Well, I'm just going to (Competitor's) then!"" As if they expect me to care. I'll care about the profits my company makes when they start using those profits to pay us a decent wage.

 I worked at Target for over a year 

Well, I guess it can depend on what type of store you're working at. Sure, I guess if you're in a Target or Walmart, it's usually how you're describing it. (I assume you were on the floor, getting asked random questions?-if you'd been at customer service taking returns and dealing with a long line, having a coworker dealing with half that line would make a difference.) As for whether the original OP would be causing problems for coworkers, I have a second job in a grocery store, and based on what I've seen, it'll probably depend on which specific department he works in.

I work at a fabric store, and mostly stand behind a counter cutting fabric. That customer can't buy the fabric without me either cutting it or measuring it for them.  If I'm helping customer number 1, and don't have a coworker to help customer number 2, customer number 2 is going to just to wait in line. Same for customer number 5, 6, 14, 21...

There is no scenario where telling the customer ""I'm busy"" will result in them walking away and not waiting for my help.

And if I'm working a closing shift, I have to have all the bolts of fabric (which we were cutting from) put away before I leave. If I don't, I'm getting fired. If my coworker is there, one of us can put bolts away while the other cuts for customers. If she doesn't show up, the bolts pile up, and I have to take care of this huge pile after the store closes.



We were talking about kitchens too, do you think they get to just tell a customer ""I'm busy"" and then just never serve them?_____ but I was careful to be respectful and phrase my complaint as a suggestion they train people better rather than a criticism of the particular employee.

, and I say this as an employee in retail who meets my fair share of asshole customers.

And the kid's job is in less jeopardy due to this complaint from you than it will be if someone calls back irate because, due to following his advice, they really did kill their lobsters. It's in the manager's hands now, and we can only hope that he has the common sense to teach that kid what to say.

(edited to fix typo)_____It would be one thing if he'd just ordered the wrong food and wanted a refund, (though even in that case he'd be entitled to that refund).

He was yelling and cursing, and, far worse, lying about one of your waitresses, would have gotten her in trouble with a worse manager/owner.

_____Former nanny here, just so you know that any bias I'd have would be in favor of the nanny and against the employer:

You are very much . Keeping her in your household could have caused you serious harm, and is that really the type of person you want caring for your daughter?
  firing someone especially during a pandemic. 

Look at it this way, now there's a job opening for someone else who probably needs it just as much. You should be fair to any nannies, but you have to put the well being of you and your daughter first._____ 
  I told her if this had been a male doing it, we would have excluded him too.

That doesn't make a difference. You acted horrifically wrongly regardless of whether your motivation had anything to do with gender. 

Was the ability to use cursing sooo important to you? (and you're clearly unprofessional in that you must not care much about the company or getting things done if you're instructing people not to help this one pseron solely in order to sabatoge them so that you can get back to cursing). You should be fired._____.

His customer service was terrible. It's better to trust that the customer is honest.

maybe you’re too young to remember the cause for “it gets better”. young teens lost after being bullied for their sexuality was a daily thing you’d see on the news. ppl like you constantly bullying and provoking and hurting. and it wasn’t to only teens that were out but to ppl like your brother who weren’t safe or ready to make that choice yet. this was just 10 years ago. and it still happens today. 

1. is being gay funny or smth to ridicule for you, why?
2 what “behavior” or things he said made you think he was gay? were you just going off stereotypes?
3. why are you picking being gay as smth to bully your brother with? 
4. why wouldn’t you support your brother if you thought that was a possibility 
5. why were you avoiding saying this in front of your parents; have they said homophobic potentially violent or hate filled comments?

you are homophobic. you’ve done a huge disservice to your brother. and instead of apologizing and offering support you’re playing the victim that you’re innocent bc you didn’t know he was actually gay.

even if he wasn’t gay you were still bullying him! this just makes it worse. this is basic empathy. and while i would explain with an analogy for you, frankly i’m too annoyed to not make it insulting. 

apologize. then do research and apologize again._____i disagree completely. ops sister is using the benefit of common decency and understanding for a very personal moment(her coming out) as a shield for her consistent sexual harassment. 

isn’t this nearly exactly what kevin spacey did? 
let’s be clear. ops sister is a monster. she is harassing someone for months continuously in their own home. she is abusive and terrorizing, even after continuous nos. op,  for protecting your fiancé from her harasser. your sisters actions are vile. when someone says no, that needs to be respected, not ignored bc you don’t want to make them uncomfortable._____Yta. What is wrong with you? Seriously, you need professional help. You believe that your bil cheated on your friend and is abusive to your sister with no proof! And then you make a heinous accusation against them that can tear their family apart. Are you lonely and need attention, because this is incredibly toxic behavior. What makes you think you know your sister is being abused or that BIL is a a cheater, your intuition? Take some probiotics bc that gut is rotten. Honestly, at least your family can cut you out and finally have peace(hopefully)._____she wants to protect them she can contact CPS. her aunt and cousin have 0 power to do anything to help their siblings. 

it was simply a move to shame and embarrass them. and it’s NOT ops news to share, whether she’s happy or not for them. it’s a gross overstep._____Respect is not commanded it’s earned. And given the fact that he threatened the brother and was arrested for conspiracy to commit murder I’m not sure the brother would welcome this conversation._____ 
You want to provide a stable home for your nephews. 
Your sister seems abusive and violent, why didn’t she get charged with assault for hitting your parents?
Look into adult protective services. If she’s threatening them, physically abusing them, and pushing your mom into a mental break, she needs to leave them alone."	care:8,authority:3,sanctity:1_____care:5,authority:2,sanctity:2_____sanctity:1,loyalty:1,care:2,fairness:2_____care:3,authority:1,sanctity:1_____authority:3,care:2_____care:5	1_____0_____1_____1_____1

Of course the actual bullies are the ones to primarily be angry at. But what's the way to end what they're doing?
Research shows the most effective way to end bullying is bystander intervention. And he couldn't do it even when the bullied person was his own sister. 

I don't think punishing him is right, though. Talking to him is, which your wife already did._____

Btw, your dad being Jewish or not Jewish doesn't matter anyway, because Jewishness is passed down on the mother's side. (It's like membership in a tribe--it's not exactly a genetic thing). In order to be religiously Jewish, of course, neither parent has to be, if you think the religion is true you can convert, (and after doing that, you'll be considered Jewish in every sense) but if you're not entirely sure as far as the religion goes, there's nothing wrong with you attending events.

I'm Jewish via my mother, but am religiously Catholic. I've attended religious Jewish events, however, with people knowing I wasn't religiously Jewish, but without having to tell them that I actually was technically Jewish. It can depend on how welcoming the community you find is, but you're not an asshole either way._____
 and this is how family works”

Some babysitting from older siblings is normal. Not the degree of childcare that he seems to be expecting. He doesn't seem to know how parenting works.
 they had so much help from my grandparents and aunt that I almost considered myself raised by them rather than my own parents, from this I kind of feel like my dads expecting this to happen again with my brother. 

Wait, so the grandparents cared for their first kid, now their kid will care for the other one? Something tells me these people (your parents) wouldn't consider it their job to raise your hypothetical kid the way their parents raised you._____ we give him money every month to help pay for college expenses/clothes/food etc...He's been asking his step mom to do things for him like clean his room/do his laundry etc but she stopped after she started having health issues. He took it as in she doesn't want him in our house anymore

I feel sorry for his future wife if she says yes.

 for the ring thing.

But stop spoiling him in general._____.

How cruel can you be? These were living creatures. 

And (1) he cared about them, (2) he was an eleven year old, eleven year olds forget about things, and (3) I was a child to divorced parents, do you have any sympathy for how hard being torn between two households is for a kid? I'm not saying you guys shouldn't have gotten divorced, but it is due to you htat he has to go from household to household, which makes it easy enough to forget things, and even if the divorce was the right decision, you have to take responsibility for the effect it has on your kid._____.

As I understand it, your son is already paying for things in your household even though he's not living there?

He's already being very generous, and doing what he's not obligated to do. I think there is some merit to the idea which is more prevalent in other cultures of adult sons and daughters helping their parents, but that becomes more of a (possible) obligation in the parent's old age, when they're becoming helpless. You're still able to work and support yourself, even if things are tough.

It would be nice of your son to help pay for his sister's laptop, but he's not obligated to do so. 

Bear in mind that he's preparing to get married. This isn't just about the wedding---he might also be planning on children of his own. If so, he has to bear his future children in mind-his family no longer consists in just you and his siblings."	care:3,authority:4,loyalty:1_____care:1,sanctity:4,loyalty:2,authority:1_____loyalty:1,care:5_____care:2,sanctity:3,loyalty:1_____sanctity:2,care:4_____care:3,loyalty:1,sanctity:1	0_____1_____1_____1_____1

 I promised I'd never put my own children through that.

there's a huge difference between throwing your kid out because they have now hit legal adulthood and throwing out a drug addict who refuses to get proper help and brings/uses illegal shit into the home you own(where it could also land you in legal trouble). if he wants to shoot, snort or smoke, he can do it in his own space that is not near you or the rest of the family. 

 and said he'd go back to rehab for me,

this could be pandering or this could be serious but given his immediate reaction to you saying no i'd say it was pandering. he just doesn't want to lose his cushy set up.

 My husband thinks I went too far and we could've gotten him more help

help is only helpful when when the person truly wants it. your son has proven he is not ready yet. maybe being forced to go it on his own will wise him up._____!! 1)do not undermine your husbands parenting. i highly doubt you'd be ok, in any way, with your husband going behind your back to undue punishments. i imagine you'd feel pretty damn disrespected and hurt.  2)your husband is trying to teach your children life lessons. don't stop that. they need to learn and his lessons are pretty important to learn. he's trying to teach them that actions have consequences. don't stop that. they need to learn that now. when your kids do things in the grown up world they will not have mommy to go behind them and make it better. he's trying to teach them respect, especially respecting peoples ""stop"" and ""no"". i'm sure you don't appreciate people ignoring yours, well, neither does your husband or the general public which your teens will soon be part of.  3)once or twice is fine but damnit, no one wants to listen to the same damn song 30 times a day. most people would feel like they were going insane._____!! you treated your son, for 15 years, as if he was too stupid to function(as the saying goes). you didn't protect him, you just put the pain off til a later date. there are a multitude of ways to explain to young children what jail is. ""daddy broke the rules and had to go to jail"", ""what's jail, mommy?"" ""jail is a building where adults go for time out when they break rules. sometimes the timeout is short, sometimes the timeout is really long"". you really bunged this up. firstly, you need to apologize like crazy. you can explain why you did what you did but you must admit to him that you were wrong to go about it the way you did. it won't make him immediately forgive you or anything but admitting you were wrong and that you fucked up goes a long way with kids(lots of parents don't seem to understand that). secondly, you need to schedule therapy. individual for him so he can cope with your betrayal and his feelings, family for the two of you as your dynamic now has no trust on his end and you will need to figure out together how to get it back and family for him and his dad so they can learn how to become family again with the least amount of stress._____!! and you and your husband need couples counselling to get on the same page cause the situation as it is now is not tenable long term. i know it's just one post but i see divorce in your future if he doesn't get on the ball in concern to his children and their behaviour. bullying, theft and destruction of property are not ok and should not be brushed under the rug. your daughters mental health and property should not suffer because he wants to be cool dad with lazy parenting."	care:3,fairness:2,authority:3,sanctity:2_____care:4,authority:5,fairness:1_____loyalty:1,authority:3,care:2,sanctity:2_____authority:4,care:3,sanctity:1_____fairness:2,loyalty:2,care:3,authority:1_____sanctity:1,fairness:1,care:5,authority:1	0_____1_____1_____1_____1

I have two very healthy kids and I never came close to gaining 30 lbs. 16 pounds with my first and 18 with my second. Many healthy women simply do not put on much weight during pregnancy beyond what the baby needs   in the first trimester even when you're not vomiting you often feel nauseous. If she's managing to eat regularly then she's doing fine. You making food a battleground will only up her stress levels and damage her relationship with food and her changing body. There's no indication her eating is disordered by the way, you're the one trying to count her calories and dictate when she's had enough to eat. Fun fact, she's a grown woman, I promise you she can tell when she's hungry._____ Generally I would say that you shouldn't override what a parent wants for their child. But it sounds like the mom has a disordered relationship with food and is abusing the kid via these diets. My mother was the same way   there was a solid two years where I was drastically underweight because her eating disorder meant she would only buy low calorie and zero calorie food. Being 88 pounds at 5 ft 7 is not a good look. A friend's parents started feeding me   taking me to the store and I credit them with me developing some semblance of healthy eating habits._____  In this case it sounds like she's engaging in medical abuse (she's been lying to him about his own body for years and that's a reason to call his father and the authorities) , but you really should not have joined in feeding him the meat._____Just make healthy snacks the standard for all the kids. The junk food isn't actually good for the skinnier kids and the family dynamic is setting the youngest up for an eating disorder. Given her activity level the issue isn't what she's eating, it may just be her body type post puberty is going to be curvier than her sister or the OP.

OP, I encourage you to get some therapy.  You are blaming your wife for simply being who she is, which is not within her control.  You will be happier if you accept that and work with her on ways to mitigate her shortcomings, rather than blaming her for it.  It sounds like your relationship is dysfunctional around these issues.  Both of you can do things to improve that.  If you know you can’t trust her to remember things, then stop relying on her to do so.  Crazy is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  What you are doing isn’t working.  Try something else.

Him for misleading you about his sexual status and you for cheating on him instead of just openly dealing with the problem.  You deserve to be fulfilled sexually and be able to have children.

My guess is that you will end up getting divorced, but it may be that his deception is sufficient to justify an annulment.  Regardless, good luck with it.  It's a shitty situation with no easy solution and my heart goes out to you._____.  Lying to your wife is a huge problem.  A friend of mine who is a professional business coach likes to say, “Everything you want is on the other side of a sweaty ten minute conversation.”

You might want to consider some therapy yourself to work through your feelings about it. Regardless, you absolutely do need to take care of yourself and your children.  If you can't provide a safe, sane home for your children with her there, then asking her to live somewhere else is reasonable.

test	not wanting to put my young kid on psychotropic drugs	"YTA

&gt; ""I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary""

If your son is constantly causing disruptions to the point where the other kids in his class aren't able to obtain a proper education due to the constant disruptions, then yeah, it sounds like it is 100% necessary.

&gt; ""I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing""

Repeated incidents of your son acting in a ""I'm going to do what I want, fuck you"" manner are NOT a 'little thing'.  

&gt; ""My son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid""

And? Do the other kids in his classes not deserve to have an uninterrupted chance at an education - or should they suffer through it because hey, ""kids will be kids""?

_____It sounds like he IS throwing tantrums and causing disruptions in the classroom.  It doesn't matter if it's something as 'minor' as playing a random song on an instrument after the teacher asked him several times not to do so - Once kids that age get off track, it's hard as hell to get class back on track.   If the teacher lets one kid act up, they're all going to think they can do that - and that's how you end up with an unruly classroom full of 8 years olds and not a single one of them learning anything.   Guess what happens to the teachers in that situation? They end up getting in trouble and potentially losing their jobs - and it all could've been avoided by a kid temporarily going on medication.

No one is saying OP's son has to live on the medication forever, but maybe going on it for awhile until he has some more therapy and self-help tools under his belt isn't the worst idea.  _____Ah, we had a kid like that in a class in high school - only he lashed out at one of the biggest teachers on staff who did not hesitate to restrain him until the cops showed up (yeah, it devolved THAT quickly)_____You also said the school psychologist wasn’t qualified to make a diagnosis of ADHD.  School psychologists are still psychologists and have to go through extensive training.  Depending on the level of that training, that person is absolutely qualified to say “hey, think this kid might have this”_____Everyone thinks their kid is a great kid - Doesn't mean he isn't disrupting the learning of the other kids (whose parents, I'm sure, think that they are also great kids)._____Are you really comparing a Lobotomy (in which they do a procedure to permanently alter the brain structure) to tryin a medication (which can easily be reversed if OP’s son doesn’t mesh well with the med)?"	actualdisasterbi	It's wrong to put your kid on psychotropic drugs._____It's okay to not want your child to take drugs._____It's wrong not to help out your child if they are ill._____it's inconsiderate to put your kid on psychotropic drugs._____it's good not to help out your child if they are ill.	care-harm_____care-harm|authority-subversion_____care-harm_____care-harm_____care-harm	b7dpgd	YTA	1.0	1	0	"It's crazy around here - It doesn't help that the predominate health system around here is catholic and they generally kick up a fuss whenever a woman wants to protect herself from getting pregnant but still have sex._____OP is well within his rights to not want a surgery - but OP's wife is also within her rights to say ""My body has been through enough from the last two pregnancies; It's YOUR turn to sacrifice your body for the better interest of the rest of the family for a change.""_____You didn't sit down and have a discussion, you essentially tried to blackmail your wife into either (A) remaining pregnant (""If you have the abortion, I'll divorce you!"") or (B) divorcing you, which would leave her a single mother._____If it was anything child related, it's a safe bet that the courts would rule that he have no further contact with the child whatsoever (or else it could then put the custody at risk for the mother, with the kid winding up dropped into foster care or a group home)_____#2: It's perfectly reasonable for a mother to give the child her last name in the event that she and the child's father aren't married._____  ""this is a hill I'm willing to die on"" Are you also willing to sacrifice any relationship you have with your daughter or any chance of her coming to you for help in the future?"	authority:1,care:3,sanctity:1_____loyalty:3,sanctity:1,fairness:1_____loyalty:1,sanctity:2,fairness:1,care:1_____care:4,loyalty:1_____care:2,sanctity:1,authority:1_____authority:1,care:2,loyalty:1	" (though it wouldn't be too difficult to slip into  at this point)

I absolutely understand that you can't take the cats in - but saying things like ""This isn't constructive to her wanting to better herself"" is borderline .  Yes, she should absolutely get out of the abusive relationship, but I understand her mindset of not wanting to leave the cats behind (especially if the abusive partner has threatened harm to them, which many abusers do if they think they can use the threat to control the person they are abusing).  That doesn't mean your fiance's sister is trying to take advantage of you - It's just the abused victim mindset._____ (your Mom, however, is definitely an asshole in this case, IMO).  

If your sister truly wants your mom to stay out of the delivery room, she can tell the hospital staff as much and your mom will be banned from the delivery room.  My brother and his wife gave birth back in December and at this specific hospital, they had to give a list of preapproved visitors so that anyone who was NOT preapproved didn't get an id tag (The maternity ward required an id card to enter, it remained locked otherwise 24/7).  They could at any time revoke the ID card by telling a nurse (who I'm assuming would escalate it up the chain of command to whomever handled that, presumably security).  

If your Mom doesn't learn to respect her daughter in-laws wishes, she may rapidly find herself banned from seeing the baby at the hospital altogether - and your brother may join her if he doesn't support his wife (Yes, the one delivering can absolute choose to have the father banned from the delivery room too)._____

Your daughter SHOULD learn to manage her time

BUT

This ain't the way to go about doing it.

  ""this is a hill I'm willing to die on""

Are you also willing to sacrifice any relationship you have with your daughter or any chance of her coming to you for help in the future? Because that's what's going to happen.

My Dad tried that ""You need to learn to manage shit on your own"" routine too - so when a situation came up when I really could have used his help, I just kept hearing his ""no, you're on your own"" speech replaying in my head and was too afraid to approach him for help. 

That's the kind of ""fear"" you're instilling in your child when you say ""No, you're on your own, I'm not helping you.""._____

You should divorce your wife and leave this family alone.   First of all, that's such a fucking scumbag move on both your part and your sister in-law's part.   It's an incredible betrayal of trust to do it even once - but now you're wanting to leave your wife for her sister???

Great, so not only will your wife (ex-wife?) have to live with the knowledge that you fucked her sister and frequently fantasized about her sister while having sex with her, but she'll have to see you all cozied up with her sister at all future family functions/holidays/etc.

_____Good plan.  Luckily, when it came to my brother's situation, our Mom was chill - but his MIL was not.  Speaking to the nurses/doctors/coordinators at the hospital to have a plan in place definitely helped sooth any fears they had about someone showing up and starting a ruckus.

I'm glad to hear your SIL is madly in love with your brother - but this is a highly stressful time.  Her comfort in this case is more important than not ruffling the feathers of someone who can't accept that no means no._____  ""She is 25 years old and not even trying to help herself""

That you know of.  Unless you're up her ass 24/7, you have no idea what she is doing.  Regardless, at 25, I was completely disabled by panic disorder, depression, and agoraphobia.  Maybe your sister in-law is really struggling with mental illness and is, in fact, NOT the lazy piece of work you're making her out to be.

  ""What if they get into an accident?""

Okay, using your logic, you're never going to be able to let your husband drive your children around regardless because what if they get into a car accident?

I get that it's scary and you're concerned about the safety of your husband and child - I really do.  However, car accidents can happen anywhere at any time.   Even if his sister is NOT with him, he could still wind up getting into a car accident taking your son to a doctor's appointment or something.  These things are horrible, but they happen all the time - It's not your sister in-law's fault if they happen when she's with him.

 I worked at Target for over a year 

Well, I guess it can depend on what type of store you're working at. Sure, I guess if you're in a Target or Walmart, it's usually how you're describing it. (I assume you were on the floor, getting asked random questions?-if you'd been at customer service taking returns and dealing with a long line, having a coworker dealing with half that line would make a difference.) As for whether the original OP would be causing problems for coworkers, I have a second job in a grocery store, and based on what I've seen, it'll probably depend on which specific department he works in.

I work at a fabric store, and mostly stand behind a counter cutting fabric. That customer can't buy the fabric without me either cutting it or measuring it for them.  If I'm helping customer number 1, and don't have a coworker to help customer number 2, customer number 2 is going to just to wait in line. Same for customer number 5, 6, 14, 21...

There is no scenario where telling the customer ""I'm busy"" will result in them walking away and not waiting for my help.

And if I'm working a closing shift, I have to have all the bolts of fabric (which we were cutting from) put away before I leave. If I don't, I'm getting fired. If my coworker is there, one of us can put bolts away while the other cuts for customers. If she doesn't show up, the bolts pile up, and I have to take care of this huge pile after the store closes.



We were talking about kitchens too, do you think they get to just tell a customer ""I'm busy"" and then just never serve them?_____ but I was careful to be respectful and phrase my complaint as a suggestion they train people better rather than a criticism of the particular employee.

, and I say this as an employee in retail who meets my fair share of asshole customers.

And the kid's job is in less jeopardy due to this complaint from you than it will be if someone calls back irate because, due to following his advice, they really did kill their lobsters. It's in the manager's hands now, and we can only hope that he has the common sense to teach that kid what to say.

(edited to fix typo)_____It would be one thing if he'd just ordered the wrong food and wanted a refund, (though even in that case he'd be entitled to that refund).

He was yelling and cursing, and, far worse, lying about one of your waitresses, would have gotten her in trouble with a worse manager/owner.

_____Former nanny here, just so you know that any bias I'd have would be in favor of the nanny and against the employer:

You are very much . Keeping her in your household could have caused you serious harm, and is that really the type of person you want caring for your daughter?
  firing someone especially during a pandemic. 

Look at it this way, now there's a job opening for someone else who probably needs it just as much. You should be fair to any nannies, but you have to put the well being of you and your daughter first._____ 
  I told her if this had been a male doing it, we would have excluded him too.

That doesn't make a difference. You acted horrifically wrongly regardless of whether your motivation had anything to do with gender. 

Was the ability to use cursing sooo important to you? (and you're clearly unprofessional in that you must not care much about the company or getting things done if you're instructing people not to help this one pseron solely in order to sabatoge them so that you can get back to cursing). You should be fired._____.

This is pretty minor. He is blowing this way out of proportion.

From personal experience, when my wife and I first got together, she had a good friend profess his love for her. She turned him down, but he couldn't let it go. She had to cut him off completely.  Many, many years later, she made a facebook account for our kids pictures. One of the first people to message her was this guy, asking how she was doing.  She went to his profile, checked up on him, and told me about it. She never messaged him back, because that door is closed for her.  I didn't care. It's totally normal for her to be curious about what he got up to, and she looked at his pictures and was like ""Oh, OK"" and that was that._____. JFC this dude sounds like a real catch.

That works for us, but I wouldn't call it more or less fair than a 50/50 split.  In fact, some might argue that it is still unfair, because I have more disposable income left over each month than she does.

I imagine he would have been torn to shreds. 

In this case, he deliberately dials it back so that he can find out if women are interested in him for who he is, rather than what he has.

He isn't assuming anything about the women, nor going out of his way to impress them, he is just presenting himself as ""normal"" and letting them show who they are.

I do something similar when I meet people for the first time.  I am a professor and vice president at a major research university.  If I introduce myself to new people that way, I can often see the lights go out in their eyes.  I imagine they are thinking something along the lines of, ""Oh shit, this guy is super smart and he is going to think I'm an idiot.""  Or maybe ""Oh shit, this guy is a giant fucking nerd.  I hope to god he doesn't start talking about whatever esoteric crap he works on.""  Regardless, it is almost impossible to connect with random people if I start by telling them what I do, so if they ask, I often just say, ""I work at the University.""  If they ask for details, I am honest, but I only lead with it when I am talking to someone I know won't be intimidated by it (e.g., with doctors, who stop talking down to me when I tell them)._____.  As you know, junkies cannot be trusted.  Letting one into your home is a threat to your sobriety and your well-being and you know that any money you give him will go toward drugs.  It is painful to have to turn your back on somebody in need, particularly somebody who has helped you, but you cannot help him by giving him access to your home or your money._____.  If he can't do it, he can't do it.  You cannot share finances with him if this is how he manages his money.  It will ruin both of you.  One solution is for you to manage all of the finances, but that infantilizes him and allows him to continue being irresponsible.  A better solution might be to let him know that you will not be getting married until he shows that he can be fiscally responsible.  In my state, all debts are shared debts, so even if you keep your finances separate after marriage (as my wife and I do, for similar reasons), he can still pull you down._____.   It wasn't repayment, because you don't repay gifts.  He just straight up stole the child support from you._____Exactly.  They were specifically given to you, so they are yours.  I live in a “community property” state with very strong laws dictating that upon divorce, nearly everything is split 50/50.  The one major exception is gifts specifically given to one partner.  The fact that you have documentation makes it iron-clad.  They are yours.  Also, you know your ex would sell them, so his arguments are full of shit.  ."	care:2,loyalty:2,fairness:4_____loyalty:1,authority:2,care:1,fairness:1_____care:3,fairness:1,sanctity:1_____care:2,sanctity:2,loyalty:1_____fairness:3,care:1_____sanctity:1,authority:1,fairness:1,loyalty:1	0_____1_____1_____1_____0

OP's sister is an adult who tried to publicly bully a child based on bigotry. Moral high ground never mattered to her, all that mattered was abusing her nephew to get him to comply with her hateful beliefs. Now she's trying to rely on the false idea that there is a moral way to fight oppression to avoid dealing with the consequences of her choices. Civility is a great way to maintain the status quo. It does absolutely nothing to combat oppression. The narrative of the moral high ground assumes that it matters (which it does not) who follows arbitrary behavior rules in an unfair fight._____The sister already thinks abusing a child because of her bigotry is okay. She was going to justify her behavior regardless of his response, she just learned to leave him alone. You seem focused on changing the oppressive person's mind. We already know that rarely happens. What does work is fighting back, and you don't become the oppressor because you defended yourself. Victims of abuse don't owe their abuser more kindness or respect. They owe their abuser nothing but shutting them down. She's an adult who is continuously making hate her priority, now she gets to live with the consequences_____The kids will grow up together and it would absolutely hurt the older sister if middle sister who has ignored her kids and her is now nice to younger sister/younger sister's kids. Creating a new rift isn't a solution. The middle sister's expressed desire seems to be about not being excluded not out of any interest in the pregnancy or baby. She's not entitled to ignore her sister/sister's kid and expect to then be treated like she's been wronged. She asked to be left out, she was, now she's upset that youngest sister is getting closer to older sister as they share parenting. There's no net gain here to hurting older sister for the OP and frankly it's appalling that people think this behavior from middle sister is healthy or normal._____ And honestly the state will step in   take custody if she can't get it together. Your sister is choosing this man over her child   that's an awful thing to do. She's his victim, but she's abusing her son by proxy by not leaving this man that hates him. Bare minimums he should have been gotten out when the ""sin made flesh"" nonsense started. _____ The update doesn't change the fact that you refuse to accept that your brother has his own life that doesn't revolve around you or your mother. And that his wife isn't the villain for expecting to come first in her marriage or with her decisions about parenting her child._____She doesn't yet have 3 living children. She's still in the middle of a high risk pregnancy during a pandemic. I don't think it is that she doesn't care about her sister so much as there's only so much she can control here. She can not bring up pregnancy to her sister (and she doesn't), but she can't control what other people say, nor can she (also chock full of hormones) take being the object of her sister's ire for something that is no one's fault, but especially not hers. I understand that you chose to bend over backwards   maybe the OP could try to do more bending, but currently in the middle of her pregnancy her sister has taken to making demands, yelling obscenities and will not take herself out of situations that she finds triggering. It's likely that the husband (not on the actual call but visible in the background) said what he did innocently, then the sister instead of closing the app (which is what I would have chosen) starts yelling insults and obscenities. Sure they can exclude her from future calls, but the OP's not wrong to point out that they can't give her what she apparently needs (which is space away from pregnancy and grief counseling IMO) while still leading their actual lives. The OP can't roll back the clock on her pregnancy, she's in a high risk group for the virus so I understand why everyone is checking on her because (among other things) she's at risk of losing more than a pregnancy if she goes into a hospital right now.

Some customers think they can be verbally abusive and you have to take it, you don't.  When I was 16, I didn't really understand that.  I would let customers get away with saying the craziest shit, and instead of standing up for myself and refusing to serve them, I would just fight back tears (sometimes unsuccessfully) and try to do my job as quickly as possible to just end the interaction.

I actually remember the older (older as in college age) coworker who told me I need to learn to stand up for myself, that I'm not paid to take that shit. If someone is verbally abusing me, I can politely refuse them service and ask them to leave.  And if they refuse, I can escalate it to someone above me and let them deal with it, because I'm not being paid to be abused by customers._____ - you wouldn't be an asshole for asking, but it doesn't sound like they're going to see you as deserving of a raise, based on what you've posted here.

If that's true, you might have better luck if you waited until you have one of those better offers on the table.

That way you don't risk a period of joblessness with your ultimatum._____ - I was leaning the other way until 

 there was something i needed to do that was due the next day and important to the company. Usually takes 2 days to complete. I worked 0 days of it since i both planned to quit and also i wouldnt even do it properly without guidance. No one was free to help yet. A coworker handles half of it with me, but since i didnt even start it yet and im quitting, it means she has to do 2 days work in 1 day.

 This is my second time at this company but i was in a totally different department. I quit the first time due to unresolvable communication issues. That time, i put in 2 weeks and coded my team a little program to help automate the work. HR loved that and recommended me a few months later for this position. Just feels like im going to make HR look bad now..

 One of my colleagues (who I hadn’t yet informed that it was my birthday) suggested that we head over to the new Italian place for lunch 

So someone who didn't even know it was your birthday suggested lunch, why on earth would you assume anyone is going to pay for you just because it's your birthday? Unless someone offers, I don't know why you would expect it. No one owes you lunch just cuz it's your birthday.

 I was so upset I put down cash to cover around half of my order, the money we pooled together obviously came up short and people were very confused, one of the senior staff ended up paying the difference and I said nothing obviously.

That makes you an even bigger asshole, causing an issue and forcing someone else to pay half your meal. Shame on you._____ but only because you say that sharing the till is common practice.

If I misunderstood and its tamales in addition, then I'd suck it up and pay $10 even if I didn't plan on eating any tamales. But I don't think I'd be down to pay for someone to just entirely fuck up my Thanksgiving dinner...

what you said...

 That we go out to friends outings and playing on the PS4.

he's right, that is different. he wants outings with YOU, not all your friends. he wants to watch movies, not games. why? because they are more intimate. real hard to cuddle and be close when both your hands are occupied, cords are everywhere and you shout at the screen when you die. games can be couple time but they aren't as intimate. be honest with yourself....how much time do you devote to screens and friends compared to alone, intimate time with your SO? given his actions i'd say the former might get way more than the latter.

I can almost guarantee none of them have dealt with dementia up and close and personal, or they would never be so cavalier about it.

deep breaths

Sorry for the language, but my family has been through almost this exact situation. Complete with asshole relatives.

I'm also an in-home health aide, and I was heavily injured by a dementia patient. At the stage your father is in, it is not safe for you to try to care for him alone.

Depending upon the state you live in, and the insurance/benefits your father has, he may qualify for a variety of things, ranging from a nursing home to in-home care.

Do not neglect yourself to take care of him. It may sound callous, but his life is mostly over - dementia is an evil thing. It saps the memory, the strength, and even the enjoyment right from the person.

You are absolutely not an asshole._____... Difficult one. As the father, he should have some input, as it is his child too. On the other hand, this guy is a host of bad news. You are also wanting out of the relationship completely, clean break. Having a child together makes that impossible.

He hasn't treated you with respect and dignity, despite you declaring him an overall decent person. So I am going to go with ._____

Sorry, but absolutely yes. You should love your children equally, and treat them equally. It's not too late to modify that behavior before it starts affecting them both. Perhaps a therapist?

However. I do understand, somewhat. The firstborn has autism, and you've spent more time working with that. The younger has started developing ""normally,"" so part of you has decided he needs less attention. It is not uncommon, but you have to actively make sure not to prioritize one over the other. It's a delicate thing, making sure the elder receives the proper amount of care without seeming to favor him. Perhaps now that it's been pointed out, you can work on it.

I'm sure many parents (I am not one, so I have no idea) may prefer one child over the others, but if you show it, bad things can happen. Younger could very well resent Elder because of it, and lash out._____

You are ABSOLUTELY not an asshole for this. People with dementia change drastically, and can be VERY dangerous. There's a reason dementia wards are nearly always locked wards, and it isn't just so one of the patients doesn't wander out into traffic.

Since he has the diagnosis, you might want to look into getting Power of Attorney for him, as well as Medical Power of Attorney. That will let you properly manage his finances and other problems, including arranging care.  He may qualify for in-home health at this stage, which would take the burden of his ADLs (Activities of Daily Living) off of you.

I repeat, you are not the asshole in this situation. This demented thing that is replacing the loving man that was your father is. It is a terrible thing to witness. But it will be worse if you don't get away now._____

You have no idea what that thing is, and it's leaking fluid. Your child is far more vulnerable than your mother.

Your father needs to get it looked at. For all he knows, the thing is developing blood poisoning. His deductible may be high, but is his life worth less? (And I hate to go this route, but whatever it takes: How is he supposed to be a good grandad if he dies because he wouldn't get thia thing looked at?)_____There's a reason I phrased it that way. Because it helps a little if you separate ""dad"" from ""dementia patient."" It helps keep the good memories a step removed from the crap that happens afterward. Of course you love your father, but as the dementia progresses, there's less of him there.

I went through it with my grandmother, so I do understand how hard it can be to watch it happen. I also worked on a dementia/Alzheimer's ward in a nursing facility, and know exactly how dangerous dealing with them can be."	care:8,loyalty:1,authority:1_____authority:2,care:1,loyalty:1,sanctity:2_____care:3,authority:2_____care:4,authority:1_____care:3,authority:1,sanctity:1_____care:4,authority:1	1_____0_____1_____0_____0

First your dad is a bad father. He should be helping to promote a positive atmosphere and push you to succeed not destroying your self esteem. Secondly you are totally justified in ignoring him and pretending that he doesn't exist. However, you went too far when you were at family gatherings and you ""would make it known that I was upset and when  distant family members and friends asked me what was wrong I told them that my dad knew why."". That was a bit excessive and unnecessary. The ignoring and negativity has to do with your father leave everyone else out of it. Thirdly good job on turning your life around OP. Well done.

Not your brother obviously, but you and your SIL.

She cheated on your brother, that sucks a lot, specially considering he was going through some shit (whatever that shit is, it doesn't matter).

You, in my opinion, are way worse:

 You had sex with your brother's wife while he was dying. And at least once even after he was back.
 In case the kid is yours, you want to ruin your brother's marriage (ye, the wife had a huge part on this, but you are the one willing to tell him), and probably make the kid's life harder just to be ""acknowledged""? Like ""Hey, I have this son, I made this, he is my trophy""???
 You had sex with your brother's wife while he was dying. Yes, I needed to count this twice._____.

Your daughter is being a bully and needs to be taught that's wrong.

However, I do not feel the punishment fits the crime. Leaving a teen without internet nowadays can be pretty harsh, specially depending on how they socialize with each other.

Maybe talking to her would achieve more than making her angry and resentful towards the other kid (because that's what this will accomplish)._____.

I mean, intention matters and yours is obviously to save your son from possible suffering.

However, kids don't really see color. Kids aren't racist until they are taught to. And you teaching your kid about it and making him not trust white kids might play against him.

PS: Why do you live in a place that seems to be so damn racist? I have had the luck of living in cities with a lot of different cultures so almost nobody have been racist to me (except a few petty and stupid comments), but I don't know if I would stay in a place where most people so obviously don't want me_____.

I mean, it's not a big deal, but considering she is pregnant you need to be extra sensitive around her, since she has a lot of hormones going through her body and it's pretty normal for pregnant women to feel insecure about their bodies.

  

PS: (this is besides the point, but just FYI)

  I'm not really into having sex when she's pregnant because I'm afraid something might happen to her and the child. 

Nothing will happen either for her or for the baby. At most it can get her into labour but only if it's really close to termination already. And it's completely normal and natural, it will not hurt any of them. If you still don't want to do it then it's OK, but just telling you this so you don't worry if you happen to do it._____.

Yes, you would be, because if your only reason to marry someone is that you knocked her up, you shouldn't ask her to marry you in the first place.

You can still be the kid's parent and assume responsibility without getting married to the kid's mother._____There are probably a huge amount of kids out there who don't know who their real father is. Not talking only about adoptions and insemination here.

In your case, you get to be part of this kid's life. It shouldn't matter if you gave the semen or your brother did, just love him and be a good and close uncle.

From Google (since they redact better than me):

  [A safe space is] a place or environment in which a person or category of people can feel confident that they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment, or any other emotional or physical harm.

Men are not exposed to any of that (not because of their condition as men, they can still be from a racialized group, or suffer discrimination from religion or homophobia or many others, of course)._____.

(Not everyone, your other 2 housemates sound great).

But..

You: leaving them without silverware and almost without kitchenware because the other guy is a problem seems pretty wrong. Making their lives more difficult when they need to eat anything.

The other dude and gf: Leaving it dirty after they cook, is understandable. I don't like it, but I can understand it. However, letting it stay like that for days... nope, can't understand that. Also using your food seems too much.

Anyway, I believe that the actual best solution would be just not let him impose what he wants in everyone else and if he wants to skip the meal because of it so be it._____.

You can refuse to go for drinks for any reason. It might be a bit rude if you all hang together and stuff, but if you don't like the guy you don't need to pretend to.

Instead of finding a way to nurture this kid's potential, you knuckled under to your superintendent in destroying his teen years.  At the very least, what he did was a conflict of interest.  At worst, it was completely corrupt.  And you helped him.

Here's a story for you.  I was constantly fucking around and getting in trouble in school because I was insanely bored and knew that I was smarter than all of my teachers.  I was disrespectful, out of control, and was caught stealing, drinking, smoking pot, fighting, ... lots of typical teen stuff.  Each time it was dealt with in an appropriate way.  Nobody tried to crush me or destroy my life like your superintendent did, with your help.  Today, I am Vice President of a major research university.  I wonder what John could have achieved with some appropriate mentoring._____Speaking as a professor/university vice president/campus research integrity officer, there are a multitude of harms that come from this kind of cheating:

 It harms the student doing the cheating because they don't actually learn the things that they need to learn to be proficient in their chosen profession. 
 It harms future employers because the student didn't learn what they needed to learn to be proficient in their chosen profession AND because they are hiring people that lack integrity.
 It harms the other students by artificially impacting grading curves and by lowering the value of the degree when idiots who didn't earn it go out into the workforce and suck at their jobs because they cheated their way through school instead of learning what they should have been learning.
 It harms the institution as a whole when their reputation is damaged by the idiots demonstrating how little their (fraudulently obtained) degrees are worth._____I'm with your wife on this.  You aren't an asshole for setting some conditions, but  for #3 and #4.  Speaking as a professor, there are LOTS of liberal arts degrees that lead to lucrative careers.  Trying to control your children's interests in that way is foolish.  And rather than refusing to help with out-of-state schooling, why not just promise them a set amount and let them decide how best to use it?  Frankly, you sound like a controlling jerk._____Everything you say just makes you sound worse.  , OP, both for not owning up to your past bullying, and for this nonsense: “Mental health issues are no excuse for completely failing academically.”  You sound like a heartless asshole bully who has never faced real adversity._____.  It sounds like your sister has some special needs that are not being taken care of.  Doing her homework for her doesn't help -- it actually hurts, because the school will not recognize that she needs extra help.  Repeating an extra grade is not the worst thing that could happen, and your mother is also an asshole for guilt-tripping you about this.  It is her kid, not yours, and she needs to step up and care for the kid appropriately._____I'm guessing you aren't a teacher.  College is about a lot more than just knowing the material, including showing up and doing the work when it is assigned.  In my experience, students with honest problems never just fail to show up for the final exam without letting me know (I have even received emails from the ER), but asking to take the exam after everyone else is a common way for cheaters to cheat.  Conscientious students also do not come out to their parents the day before finals, nor do they use that as an excuse for skipping the final.  In this particular case, my teacher spidey-sense tells me the guy is  lying, but even if he is not, he chose not to show up for the exam, knowing the consequences of doing so.  Poor decision-making isn't a good reason to let anyone take a makeup exam, but by your logic any lame excuse should be good enough, which would ultimately lead to writing and scheduling separate exams for everyone with any old lame excuse, which is infeasible."	care:6,fairness:1,authority:3,sanctity:1_____care:2,authority:2,fairness:3_____care:1,authority:3,loyalty:1_____care:3,authority:2_____care:4_____fairness:4	0_____0_____0_____0_____0

She's told you why she doesn't go to your family events - You just think it's a stupid reason.  

  ""As they see it, my wife doesn't love me enough put up with my in-laws.""

No, your wife doesn't want to be miserable or feel like she's the butt of the jokes.  God forbid your wife want to be treated with respect - How dare she! /s

  ""But if my sister is the devil in this story, why write off my whole family?""

Because whose side do you think the rest of your family would take - your wife or your sister?

  ""Is this a phobia or some kind of illness?""

Could be social anxiety - but I don't feel comfortable labeling it without knowing more.

  ""She has gained some weight, ok a good deal of weight, but I certainly don't care""

You clearly do if you brought up her weight in a post that is wildly unrelated to weight.

  ""Or somehow force her into facing the family, and hope that things don't get much, much worse?""

Spoiler alert:  If you try to force your wife into doing this, it will get worse - and you'll be damned lucky if she doesn't cut her losses, decided you're as bad as she thinks the rest of your family is and divorce you over it._____  ""I was more than willing to go to a couples therapist and sort out whatever issues""

Right - then why not go on your own to a therapist to find ways to deal with your apparently overwhelming need to be balls deep in someone that isn't your wife? 

  ""You are bending over backwards to defend and rationalize her, which is strange""

Yeah.  It's strange that I - a stranger - have more sympathy for the woman you swore to honor and cherish for all the days of your life than you do.  

  ""Most relationships don't withhold sex for no reason""

Exactly.  Stop and think about that one for a few minutes.

  ""IF I didn't care about her,""

Full stop - You clearly don't.  Let's not pretend that you really do love her but she's left you no other recourse.

  ""She got what she deserved""

No one deserves to get cheated on.  If you're unhappy, leave - file for divorce instead of blowing your cash on hookers.  You don't get to play whatever game it is you think you're playing._____

Reason 1:  You're blaming your affair on ""well, I feel there's no intimacy!"".  No, you had an affair because you're a cheater who couldn't keep it in his pants long enough to divorce the wife that he was no longer sexually satisfied by.

Reason 2: The whole ""if she'd gone to screenings like I SUGGESTED, they could have caught it earlier"".  That's a fucking asshole move, blaming the fact that they caught it late on your wife.  Nobody chooses to be diagnosed when it's too far advanced to do anything.  No getting out of it, this makes you an asshole.

Reason 3: I love that you're willing to divorce her if she doesn't die - but if she lives? FUCK THAT BITCH, YOU WANT A DIVORCE.   If you're truly that miserable, divorce her and be done with it rather than forcing her to put on a fake happy front so your kids don't find out how reprehensible your actions were while they're mother was quite possibly dying of cancer._____Then leave him and get a husband who is willing to help around the house.   If you have to withhold sex to con your husband into helping you, you aren't married to a man - you're married to a child trapped in the body of a man._____  ""But wouldn’t the wife have to prove that OP caused the divorce?""

All it would take for that is for the wife to say ""I would've stayed married to him if he hadn't been unfaithful to OP"".   

I am not a lawyer so I don't know the technicalities of it all, but it's dangerous territory to get involved with a married man, especially when he could be making the whole estrangement thing up.

Someone over at r/legaladvice would probably be able to help further._____Asexuals don't feel sexual attraction - It doesn't mean they don't get horny or want to have sex.  

  ""We used to fuck all the time""

Then stop and ask yourself why all of a sudden she would stop having sex.  Could it be your atrocious attitude towards her, mayhaps?

  ""Yes, there does need to be a reason""

NO THERE DOES NOT.  It's called consent.  Your wife withdrew her consent - There's no talking to her, there's no convincing her (which would be borderline coercive rape, should she have fallen for your pleas of ""BUT I HAVE NEEDS!"").

  ""Sex is important part of relationships""

For you.  The majority of us tend to care more about our partners as human beings.  You clearly only cared for your partner as far as what purpose her body could serve for you.

NO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS BY YOURSELF!

Tell those oh-so-concerned relatives of yours that they either need to take care of him themselves, help you care for him, or SHUT THE FUCK UP. If they aren't lifting a fucking finger to help, they need to mind their own goddamnned business. They have no FUCKING clue what you're going through. I can almost guarantee none of them have dealt with dementia up and close and personal, or they would never be so cavalier about it.

deep breaths

Sorry for the language, but my family has been through almost this exact situation. Complete with asshole relatives.

I'm also an in-home health aide, and I was heavily injured by a dementia patient. At the stage your father is in, it is not safe for you to try to care for him alone.

Depending upon the state you live in, and the insurance/benefits your father has, he may qualify for a variety of things, ranging from a nursing home to in-home care.

Do not neglect yourself to take care of him. It may sound callous, but his life is mostly over - dementia is an evil thing. It saps the memory, the strength, and even the enjoyment right from the person.

You are absolutely not an asshole._____... Difficult one. As the father, he should have some input, as it is his child too. On the other hand, this guy is a host of bad news. You are also wanting out of the relationship completely, clean break. Having a child together makes that impossible.

He hasn't treated you with respect and dignity, despite you declaring him an overall decent person. So I am going to go with ._____

Sorry, but absolutely yes. You should love your children equally, and treat them equally. It's not too late to modify that behavior before it starts affecting them both. Perhaps a therapist?

However. I do understand, somewhat. The firstborn has autism, and you've spent more time working with that. The younger has started developing ""normally,"" so part of you has decided he needs less attention. It is not uncommon, but you have to actively make sure not to prioritize one over the other. It's a delicate thing, making sure the elder receives the proper amount of care without seeming to favor him. Perhaps now that it's been pointed out, you can work on it.

I'm sure many parents (I am not one, so I have no idea) may prefer one child over the others, but if you show it, bad things can happen. Younger could very well resent Elder because of it, and lash out._____

You are ABSOLUTELY not an asshole for this. People with dementia change drastically, and can be VERY dangerous. There's a reason dementia wards are nearly always locked wards, and it isn't just so one of the patients doesn't wander out into traffic.

Since he has the diagnosis, you might want to look into getting Power of Attorney for him, as well as Medical Power of Attorney. That will let you properly manage his finances and other problems, including arranging care.

How cruel can you be? These were living creatures. 

And (1) he cared about them, (2) he was an eleven year old, eleven year olds forget about things, and (3) I was a child to divorced parents, do you have any sympathy for how hard being torn between two households is for a kid? I'm not saying you guys shouldn't have gotten divorced, but it is due to you htat he has to go from household to household, which makes it easy enough to forget things, and even if the divorce was the right decision, you have to take responsibility for the effect it has on your kid._____.

As I understand it, your son is already paying for things in your household even though he's not living there?

He's already being very generous, and doing what he's not obligated to do. I think there is some merit to the idea which is more prevalent in other cultures of adult sons and daughters helping their parents, but that becomes more of a (possible) obligation in the parent's old age, when they're becoming helpless. You're still able to work and support yourself, even if things are tough.

It would be nice of your son to help pay for his sister's laptop, but he's not obligated to do so. 

Bear in mind that he's preparing to get married. This isn't just about the wedding---he might also be planning on children of his own.

or 



I don't care about the sex, although I hope you are being safe.

The weed I'm also fairly ambivalent about, especially if it is legal where you are.

Dropping acid, however...

1) Incredibly dangerous. LSD is one of the most dangerous drugs on the market for a variety of reasons. It is frequently contaminated with other things. Or faked altogether. Not to mention the things you might do while tripping.

2) Unpredictable. You might get a mild trip that involves you staring at a table for 12 hours. You might experience euphoria. You might achieve ""enlightment."" Or you might have a 10+ hour nightmare that breaks your mind. There are people that have had permanent psychotic breaks from a bad trip. And once started, a bad trip doesn't stop until the drug wears off.

3) Illegal everywhere. Now, this one might be a little out of date, but I'm mostly certain LSD is not legal anywhere in the world. That's a lot of risk to get high.

4) Unhealthy. Aside from the mental effects, LSD can have detrimental physical effects as well. And that's aside from whatever you might do to yourself while high.

5) Long-term. LSD can stay in the system for decades. People that haven't taken it in decades can experience a sudden trip or flaahback.

And you are risking a college education that your parents have undoubtedly worked hard to provide the money for you to go.

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?_____You'd be surprised how much murderous intent those dementia patients carry. I've been strangled, clocked over the head with a walker, stabbed at with at least 4 different objects (pen, set of keys, butterknife, fork, and a piece of broken plastic offhand), nearly set on fire (whoever let the damn woman keep her lighter after smoking was an ass!), and had my head slammed in a doorway. I've also had my arm nearly torn off, various sprains, and a host of other injuries.

OP has expressly stated repeatedly that she isn't ditching him to rot. Just to get away from him directly, which I feel is the correct action. She has no training or ability to deal with this._____Several. I work in healthcare, for one. I have to be knowledgeable about things like that, because it affects the care the patient receives. I live in North Carolina - Duke, Wake Forest, and UNC hospitals are all around me, and I have spoken extensively to several of the doctors - leaders in the field - about exactly these types of conditions, because I often go to appointments with my clients. Furthermore, members of my family have certain of those issues, as does a close friend. I can't give you websites or books, however.

Alao, please note I'm not saying these disorders are going to affect everyone equally. It depends on people's individual biology to a great extent. Also, it's rare that someone would suddenly gain 100lbs without a ton of eating being involved. Mostly, these things are going to make it easy to gain a pound or two here and there, or a small steady amount over time. The trouble is losing it again. That's where most of the problems are foing to cause the most interference._____

It's not uncommon to feel that way, unfortunately. For people who really think about the world from their point of view, it becomes a horrifying thought that really never goes away.

However, I can tell you that for most, their lives are simple but happy. They generally don't have the cognitive ability to know what they are missing. The few that do either focus on what they can do, or bury themselves in so much else they can't think, or turn to drugs (usually by prescription) or... well.

And Alzheimer's is horrifying to think about, but is the best defense against itself. Because the very memory problems that are destroying your life often prevent you from realizing that you are losing it. A morbid consolation prize, to be certain.

If you want to work on this, I suggest talking to someone who works with Special Olympics and maybe doing some volunteer work. I would further suggest people with Down's or Pitt-Hopkins' as the ones to be around as they are the friendliest, most easy-going, and overall happiest.

Alternately, straight up therapy to discuss this._____

I work as an in-home health aide, CNA I. I worked at a facility previously, as well.

And I was my uncle's and grandparents' caretaker.

It really, really is very different doing for family. Especially in this case, unless you have the specific training for Alzheimer's/dementia, it can be very difficult to care for someone who is deteriorating mentally. I went through that with my grandmother._____

It sucks, but it had to be done. Maybe the job itself was causing some stress illness. I had that at a previous job. Could not figure out why I was getting sick all the time when normally I only get ""stay home from work"" sick once a year. Then my doctor asked about my job (I loathed 99% of my coworkers, especially the management) and suggested the stress had compromised my immune system. As it was a nursing home, there were plenty of germs to pick up.

If you decide to leave her, that's perfectly OK in my opinion. She was so far over the line she couldn't see the line. 

You can, of course, decide to give her another chance, as long as you deeply discuss this issues and you get to a place where you can forgive her. If not, you will just keep this in your mind and maybe throw it at her next time you have a big enough discussion.

TL;DR: If you are able to forgive her and still love her, I think it's a good idea for you to give her a chance. If you can't truly forgive that comment (and I would 100% understand that) then I believe you shouldn't._____  You're supporting an unhealthy lifestyle that's IMO granted you should never be supporting

Well, you got that part wrong. I'm completely against OP's GF choice. However, it's her choice and I don't believe anyone else should have a say in that. He did speak to her, he gave her his opinion (over a dozen times), and she doesn't care.

  Similarly to it's ok to be fat so long as you accept the health risks that come along with ones own lifestyle choice.

It's ok to be fat. It's ok to be filthy. It's ok to be whatever the hell you want, as long as it's legal.

It's her damn choice. If I get a fat SO would I tell them to get fit because it's a health risk? Maybe once. Maybe a few times if the conversation comes to that. Yet I wouldn't expect them to do as I say, I would just advice them, and if it's a dealbreaker to me, I would leave.

  that doesn't make OP the asshole for simply having reasonable standards for personal hygiene

Completely agree. Only said he was TA because it's not his decision and he acts like it is._____Not that it's any of your business but I've had some relationships and a few of them were (completely or partially) actually long-distance.

You are the one who doesn't get it: in a real relationship, you need to trust your partner, specially if it's long-distance, since almost all of the info you are gonna get is from your S.O..

Your theory right now is something like ""she purposely didn't tell him her friend's friend was a guy and they had diner together, but she did tell him that his friend is trying to get him with this dude"". That's just ludicrous, if she wanted to hide one of these facts wouldn't it be the other way around?

Then again, that's completely besides the point. The point being: if you need to control what your S.O. is doing to feel secure she's not gonna cheat on you, then it's preposterous to stay in that relationship.

If she wants to cheat on you, she can do so without you ever knowing about it; so it's stupid not to trust her and still want to stay with her for some reason._____.

However, I think your friend is right; virginity is, after all, a social construct and, even if having sex with someone special is always better, there is nothing special about the first time (except maybe that it usually sucks because of the nerves and everything).

Maybe it's healthier if she just explores her sexuality the way she wants, knowing that you won't shame her for anything and with solid knowledge of safe sex (this is where ""the talk"" goes in, it's not about virginity)._____  causing stress to your partner for no real reason

That's kind of my point. Doing what you feel like doing shouldn't cause stress to your partner. And it's not ""for no real reason"", is because it's something you want to do, for whatever reason.

  how is she supposed to know if he cheats though? she won't be there.

You missed the point about trust. That's pretty much why she needs to trust him.

  that's not trust... that's faith. cause you won't ever know.

What? You lost me there. It is trust. The first definition by the Oxford Dictionary:

  Firm belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone or something.

If you have a firm believe your SO is reliable and will tell you the truth, then you trust them. Your definition of trust looks more like ""I need proof despite what they say to me"" and that's not trust."	fairness:3,care:3,authority:1_____care:3,loyalty:1,authority:1_____sanctity:2,care:2_____fairness:2,loyalty:1,authority:1_____care:2,sanctity:2_____sanctity:1,fairness:2	1_____1_____1_____1_____0

Everyone's reaction should be apathetic? Like y'all are telling me:  Some people need a bigger reaction, some don't.  Overwhelming saying everyone should say ""I don't care"" is just plain wrong.

  ""Sexuality isnt something you should have to make the people in your life aware of""

You're right, you shouldn't - but you do.  There are still people every single day that are getting kicked out of their homes, assaulted, murdered for daring to be open about being LGBT+.  

  ""frankly once the majority of people are like OP it means that discrimination becomes less and less""

Except that the majority aren't like OP.  If anything, LGBT+ related hate crimes have increased the last couple of years.

I'm bi myself.  I didn't come out to anyone until two years ago (it'll be three years in June) and I'm 28 years old now.   Coming out takes an incredible amount of bravery - and for you to assume that the only reason your GF came out is OBVIOUSLY because she hooked up with a girl and became a cheating whore (honestly what a fucking asshole move to slutshame, regardless), speaks VOLUMES about you.

  ""it's basically a fact that bisexual women are really horny all the time""

No, you weren't.  You were being biphobic/homophobic and generally a ginormous asshole.

This wasn't validation from just anybody - It was validation from her brother.

  ""My wife is 31 years younger than me. 7 years and we're still going strong.""

Good for you (that sounds sarcastic, I'm generally glad y'all are happy) - but there's a pretty big difference between discrimination based on an age gap and discrimination towards an LGBT+ person.

No, I don't think she'd automatically have a baby sitter if she qualified. It's not that black and white. Statistically, many low income families don't apply for many reasons.

I hope you called the school to get them back and I hope he was suspended or given detention,  something.  Your mom is also an enabler, to your stepdad's worthless parenting.

You didn't beat him or abuse him, you smacked his leg. Come the fuck on. Get a safe, save money, get the fuck out of that toxic house and never speak to any of them again.

Now they have to tell two kids that neither can go. The little boy  doesn't really care as his was response. But the father said all go or none go, which also isn't the truth,  because the teen doesn't want to go. These 3 kids are already adjusting to suddenly living together when before it was occasional. Op, you aren't  an ""evil stepmother"" when the father was in full agreement to send only one kid, but changed his mind. That's the issue here. Him suddenly going against what both decided. That's why she is upset. Yes, it isn't fair to send one IF both boys cared. But dad planned to do exactly that.

 edit - UPDATE: I have reached out to the friends accusing me of overreacting.

The friend group is now fully aware of the extent and are trying to get in touch with him to remove the comment or post a retraction. A close, newer friend unrelated to this current situation is an employment/defamation lawyer who has done more for me in these past 4 hours than the alleged, hemorrhoid-ridden friend has done in the last decade.

Unless it's a really close friend that's getting a bit too self-pitying and needs a minor ass-kicking.

 Some of it was just bad decision making on my part, but a lot feels like it was out of my hands too. 

I have a lot of thoughts, lately, about the idea of control, and what we have control over as human beings. We're the only species (that we know of, so far) that can plan things out pretty far in advance, but there is an awful lot of stuff that we have absolutely no power to change about ourselves, and about the world. It's interesting._____

But only under certain circumstances. In this case, you already have a suspicion that this person is not trustworthy, and you're testing that hypothesis. In other words, you're not making up a story solely for the purpose of hurting another person or getting some kind of personal gain out of it. I judge this to be chaotic good, as long as you're careful that your made-up story doesn't have the potential to hurt anyone else.

But I do have to offer another suggestion: if you already know this person talks too much and tells everyone's business, then you have no need to do this. In cases like this a suspicion is enough - just don't tell that person anything really sensitive. 

There's also the fact that it might not work anyway - what if this person talks and spreads the story, but it just never gets back to you? that's a possibility._____

I'm really glad you told your friend, but I think you need to actively look for a professional to help you with this as well. What is your situation right now? are you in university, are you working, do you have health insurance, or do you live in a country with national health care?_____

You would never be the asshole for trying to protect a child. But as you say - this could destroy your friendship. Be prepared for the fallout._____ I told her friends she fucked him and they agreed with me, that she lowered herself.

and now you're trash talking your roommate behind her back with HER FRIENDS, and you still think you're a ""good guy"". amazing. 

also, if you think James is such a piece of shit that women should be warned about him, why are you friends with him? What's wrong with him exactly, besides his drug problem? is he violent, does he not stop when told to stop, does he rape women?

 Right now it may seem like her issues are her own issues. She's dating guys who are old enough to be her father,  which is pretty disgusting considering she is still a teen, and just out of high school or worse, about to graduate in 6 months. If she's just turned 18, she skipped a grade as a kid. That's on her.
But she also chose to get animals she is responsible for, and she's trying to bring a child into that mess of a life she has. Which is unforgivable. She's not just hurting herself then. She needs an intervention.
The valedictorian thing couldn't matter less.
It's that she is an irresponsible and selfish human. Animals she can't take care of or afford, that's her being a shit person. They will suffer. Her trying trying to get knocked up by some random guy when she has perverted older men taking care of her. When that baby somes, you can bet she will mooch off your parents,  and if they're stupid. ..
So yes, I think she's headed down a track that should make the family write her off and tell her to get her shit together or they can't be a part of her life. Tough love because right now she's spoiled thanks to your parents refusing to make her grow up, and family allowing her to stay in their home. Enabling her.
Take the valedictorian out though. She doesn't need to be like the rest of you, as long as seen can be a decent human who isn't tanking her life and behaving recklessly. Which, she is not.
Maybe being cast out like a black sheep will force her to get her shit together. This isn't working what is happening now. _____I'm not going to attack and harass a complete stranger on the internet, because abuse didn't turn me into a bully with blind rage towards others that dare disagree with me after I attack them. This attitude displays a complete lack of awareness because it says the victim may be too ""poor"" or stupid to help themselves. Which victimizes them all over again. Saying the OP shouldn't give them a wake up call and try to warn them and get them to fight against the one thing that can imprison them forever is blind and ignorant. If she's ""stupid"", then give her information. Help her find time. Telling the victim that its ok to do nothing only traps them as a victim. It's how victims stay trapped in these situations. No one telling them what they can do, no one giving them options, no one telling them they can be strong in just ONE thing. And it's one tiny little thing she can be proud of. A small step. People who can't afford these things are given help, especially in light of these situations. It would be free. The more you know._____
Modeling school is a waste of time and a scam. You are trying to wake her up to her looks and personality not being right, before she destroys her chance at a future. Her ""teachers"" have also been blunt and honest but your parents are deluded and keeping it from her. In this case, lying will harm her._____. But judgemental? Yes.
Jane is a bitch. MH is a loser with no brain and no future.
Jane told him things that you said in confidence to start shit. He started shit with you and she did nothing. He then threatened you and she blamed you. Jane is trash.
However. Don't knock the ""community college"" hs program. It makes you seem stuck up and not considering that people can't afford ""a good school"" because not every plays sports at all, much less well enough to get a scholarship. Not everyone can afford college and the smart thing to do is take gen eds at a community college or tech school or even a 2 year university because it is literally the same damn thing credit wise and less than half cost wise. No one cares if you went to x school all 4 years. Dumb as he is, he is going to be ahead of everyone else. Until he drops out because he's a trash human. _____
So your sister is from the family vacation where you both wore thongs, and they roasted you for being “indecent” and she wasn’t. She calls you names and makes fun of you for being bigger than her.
Obviously you don’t want her there, but your family are hypocritical assholes so it doesn’t matter.
You made a peanut dish and explicitly TOLD her. She pretended she didn’t know so she could act like a victim. If her daughter is so allergic that being in the room with peanuts cooked can hurt her, your sister willingly put her in danger just to make you look bad. Anyone calling you an asshole missed that. Your sister is toxic and so is your family, based on your last post. You probably should include that they fat shamed you and she harasses you and they side with her. Point blank tell them you won’t host dinners. You shouldn’t have to be around someone like that._____SHP/ Is she mentally retarded? No seriously. To behave like a 3 year old...
You gave a kid a $40 fish and just threw it in a bag? With no regard for the safety of the fish? The length of time in bag? The fact that they probably don't have a tank at all, and the fish would likely die? If they did have a tank,that they probably wouldn't introduce it correctly? Even then, can you trust her to not shake or break the tank or poke it? You essentially not only gave the fish a death sentence,  but you taught a brat that if she throws a big enough fit, she can get what she wants.
That entire family needs to be avoided and he needs to get her help. "	care:5,sanctity:3,loyalty:2,authority:2,fairness:1_____care:8,authority:1_____fairness:3,care:2,sanctity:1_____sanctity:2,care:2,loyalty:1_____loyalty:1,care:3,sanctity:1_____fairness:1,loyalty:1,care:3	0_____1_____1_____1_____1

That’s your child, your rules, and you know his dog has a history of unprovoked attack, and you have decided you don’t want your kids around this dog, that’s the end of the story. My SIL was attacked and has bad facial scars from a trusted family pet, my childhood best friend’s 2 year old was attacked by a friend’s dog, and is absolutely terrified by them now. Kids make unpredictable movements that may set a dog off, they reach for dog food while the dog is eating, they don’t understand touch and an animals signals to back off. In my town, a young girl was killed in our town when she was mauled by a family members pet, no one could get the dog off of her, the grandmother was stabbing the dog and screaming, and the police had to shoot and kill the dog to stop the attack. No one ever expects an attack to happen, and when they do they all say how sorry they are and etc. I’d personally rather have to apologize to them for being overprotective than them apologize to me for my child being injured. This is worth putting your foot down about IMO, and also, you’re the parent, of you trust other dogs around your kids, that’s ok, you’re probably also there to supervise. I don’t like my kids around vary many dogs if i am not there with a few exceptions._____Yta… dude!!! This is not some stray dog! Not some home crazy drug addict. This is a child! Let me talk to your wife, I want to give her the biggest hug I can find!! I am SO proud of her for remaining calm and handling the EMERGENCY situation with so much heart and kindness!!! The only thing is, I do think she should have called the police first, but man, I am so very happy that she had a hand in saving that girl!!!_____, start keeping the dogs locked away in your room, especially at mealtimes. Tell them family it is to control their new begging behavior, and stop giving people the chance to feed them because your vet specifically told you not to allow people food. It may seem cruel, but it’s easier to control the dogs than the people_____, you tried your best! Really! I know it feels really crappy. I rescued a group of puppies I saw a guy throw on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, and I’ve never felt like such an asshole. NO shelter or rescue or anything would take them. I literally couldn’t do anything with them. I found a shelter an hour away that would take them, drove them there, and the people that took them were SO rude to me, even though I told them I saw some guy throw the box they were in on the side of the road. Someone probably saw the dog there with the food bowls, and figured that he had JUST been abandoned, and took him._____. I don’t think your GF has a very accurate viewpoint. I know a severely impaired person with autism that has a pet, and they just have a connection that can’t really be described. She can be a bit violent during breakdowns, but has never hurt her pet. She respects her pets safe space (a pet carrier inside a larger cage like thing). Maybe to make yourself fee more secure, let the cat spend the night once or twice, slowly build up the amount of time cookie spends there_____Nta. You have legally protected rights. As a side note, I HATE people that have emotional support animals that are poorly trained that they just decide to take everywhere, because it ruins it for people who really need their animal. My niece is severely allergic to dogs, and has so many bad experiences with poorly trained animals that she just doesn’t go in places if she sees someone with an animal, even with a vest, because SO many people do this wrong.

Just as an aside, I work in a restaurant. I've worked to-go. If you order $100+ worth of to-go food and don't tip, you're a fucking asshole and here's why: putting together all of that food, making sure everything is right, making sure all the sides and ""extra dressings"" are accounted for is pretty hard work when you're responsible for ten other orders of various sizes as well as drinks, ""curbsides"", and answering the damn phone (i hate the phone).

Don't flatter yourself, this has nothing to do with you. The relationship just ran its course.

 And that the guy was a guy who was like a leader in the community and who could be trusted.

How were you supposed to know that? (Though the reality is that ""leader in the community"" doesn't actually mean someone can be trusted. Plenty of leaders in their communities have raped little kids, for example).

I'm really angry that the police, who of all people should have an awareness of the reality of violence, were so dismissive of your concerns for your safety. (And we all know that he was an older white guy and that the police would have responded very differently if he were, for instance, black).

Yeah, something like this was perfectly foreseeable.                                Either property damage or an injury. Regardless of how many times he'd come over without damaging anything/hurting himself or others, if he's doing the actions that will cause that sort of thing, it eventually happening is inevitable._____Defending yourself is when you're preventing the person from hurting you further.

 Injuring (or doing something that might injure someone) is only self defense if you have no other means of protecting yourself-in OP's case, it was probably anger/revenge, not self defense._____.

People develop a strong bonds all the time with persons who are the gender that their sexual orientation isn't attracted to. And you know what that's called? Friendship.

But you're aiming for a relationship, which works a bit differently, and which very much is affected by sexual orientation.

Your mother should respect your parenting decisions...and if she wants to do something else, she should talk to you about it, instead of going behind your back. That being said, you should have just talked to her about it instead of ""flipping out"". 


 since she never even cries to me for one. 

I know you didn't come here for advice about the bottle, but based on this detail, it doesn't sound like it's doing any harm. If your daughter is able to spend her whole time with you without crying for a bottle, then she's not dependent on one and it's not causing her to regress in her ""weaning."" (The hysterical moments are connected to being away from you, her mom-they're not just some attempt to get the bottle. Sometimes parents don't understand how upset their kids are when away from them)._____

It's almost N A H because she is in legitimate and serious physical pain, and that can make almost anyone (not just a past addict) lash out and become desperate to relieve it. I had only one leg affected in a similar accident, and (recovering at home) I'd crawled over to the open door to enjoy some sunshine and got stuck there,  unable to move from the pain.

But she's given them real reason (not the past addiction, but, rather, her husband bringing her drugs) to fear they'll accidentally kill her. She's lucky they're still giving her narcs at all. And let's talk about her husband: he didn't have the excuse of pain blinding his judgment._____  Usually being fat is not from a medical disorder. It's from lack of self control. 

Yes that's true. 

But it's also completely irrelevant.

Is giving up her seat her job because it's required as some sort of punishment demanded justice for having let herself get so fat? Is that the reason? To punish her?

If it's not because she deserves to be punished, then the question of her culpability in getting fat is completely irrelevant to the question of whether she was obliged to be the person to get up._____ (potentially).

yeah, she shouldn't have littered. But the punishment of being in a foreign country without her phone is gravely disproportionate. (and it could be questioned whether it was your job to punish people). It was no real inconvenience to you to help her._____, she's 21 years old. You don't have to agree with her, but she's more than old enough to decide for herself whether or not to go.

Even if you force her to go, she still apparently doesn't believe in God, so I'm not sure how she would actually pray or what her attendance would mean in the eyes of God.

Kicking her out for it is assholish too, and (as a religious person myself) not pleasing to God.

But it sounds like you don't actually care about what's pleasing to God, only to what your Armenian community thinks (even though, since you're actually in France not Armenia, your daughter could do just fine without being dependant on an immigrant community. I understand having ties to one's homeland, I do not understand putting that above one's actual children!)._____, and, imo, your mom's a bit of an idiot.
 The justification is that if you spend one day at a college, your experience on that day will dictate how you view the school as a whole, which will interfere with making an objective decision. 

My decision to go to the university that I went to was influenced by one specific in-person meeting with one specific professor.

Guess what? I ended up taking multiple classes with that professor, ended up doube majoring with the second major being related to her specialty, and she became a bit of an academic mentor to me. 

I know the above is just anecdotal, but I don't think it's an anecdote that's far from the norm.

 I'm now banned from going anywhere without adult supervision until I turn 18 in the summer. 

Wow. Even if they were right about it being better not to visit, this is a severe overreaction on their part.
 They have also threatened to force me into their preferred option, which I have already ruled out, because I can no longer ""make the right choice"" myself. (I know they can't really do that.)

 If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth.

You're an ass for holding money over her head. Your child is a joint responsibility.

YOU: god damn, clean out your ears and listen to what he is actually saying. 

 He constantly told me that we should spend more time together like watching movies, planning outings etc.

what you said...

 That we go out to friends outings and playing on the PS4.

he's right, that is different. he wants outings with YOU, not all your friends. he wants to watch movies, not games. why? because they are more intimate. real hard to cuddle and be close when both your hands are occupied, cords are everywhere and you shout at the screen when you die. games can be couple time but they aren't as intimate. be honest with yourself....how much time do you devote to screens and friends compared to alone, intimate time with your SO? given his actions i'd say the former might get way more than the latter.

When he told me all the things my mom had been suggesting...part of me was annoyed with her for making such shit suggestions that clearly didn't suit my personality. But I also took it as a very good sign, that my partner knew me well enough to know NOT to listen to her. 

He also put a lot of thought and time into it, which was very obvious and touching. It meant a lot that he cared enough to make it so special. I couldn't imagine how I'd feel if he had iust...tacked his proposal onto the end of someone else's special event. Like a fuckin afterthought._____

For all I know, the person's preferred pronoun is Mighty Lord. I was actually trying to not be offensive.

Assuming ""they"" is the preferred pronoun is just as bad as assuming the gender, right?

And no, I'm not being facetious. I know someone whose pronoun is fae, another person who insists (name) always be used for (name) in place of pronouns, one who really does use Divine as the pronoun, the ""lesser being"" that insists it be called it (because it is not worthy of a gendered pronoun unless a Master gives it one), and yet one more who uses Slave as the pronoun._____I don't know what has you so offended, to be completely honest.

I do actually get mistaken for a male quite often, but I also have a deep voice. I see it happen a fair amount, with fairly minor masculine traits, even just short hair. Perhaps this is a regional difference. I am familiar with the some of the local trans population, and even in the awkward transitional stage, most of them were never ""obvious"" - including my best male friend's sister.

Maybe I'm just not capable of understanding that mindset. I see a person, and I don't really see anything but a person, so perhaps no one seems obviously trans to me for that reason._____1) The ones that have sex in suits are a subcategory of furries. Please get that into your head. A subsection does not define an entire population.

Some humans are idiots. That doesn't mean all of them are. Likewise, some furries are yiffers. Not all of them are.

2) Not all of them call attention to themselves - Daniel was completely under OP's radar until OP did some social media snooping. There are flamboyant people in nearly any category. Furthermore, it's much like how some people that act or cosplay behave in costume. It's a role, a chance to step out of their normal selves.

3) What precisely bothers you about people who want to dress up in anthromorphic costumes? People dress up like cartoon, anime, video game characters, or create their own for LARPing, steampunk, Renaissance festivals, or step into the shoes of a historical figure at war renactments. People climb into costume to be actors or stuntmen or mascots. So why do furries bother you?

4) Why are you insisting it has anything to do with beastiality? Methinks thou doth protest too much. Maybe you're so appalled because ""vanilla beastiality,"" as you put it, makes you think a little too much about the real thing, and you found you like it. So you're projecting you own sick desires onto those who are enjoying a totally innocent activity.

5) Given the judgment, your hatred is not only not universal, but in the minority. The age of acceptance is arriving, and senseless hatred is no longer acceptable. Well done, humanity.

6) I know a lot about religion too. Doesn't make me a deity._____Either SHP or .

Beyond asshole, even. What's the problem with being a furry? It's not any worse than being a gamer, an otaku, a geek, a LARPer, or anything else.

Furry does not equal dressing up and having sex.

Furry does not equal beastiality.

Furry literally just means someone who like to dress up in a partial or full fursuit, or likes the idea of doing so.

I will never understand the hate furries get. Of course, I also don't understand racism, sexism, etc._____

You didn't misgender on purpose, and you did correct it. Maybe a ""Hey, sorry about that."" would have been useful, but not reading someone's profile to know beforehand is not a crime.

As a sidenote, I think the use of they/them as the pronoun for a single person is ridiculous. The only exception is DID, because then that body is housing multiple people. I am all for alternate pronouns in every other respect. But you are not plural, stop using they/them. It's a blatant disregard for language. I know someone who uses fae as the pronoun. I know someone else who insists pronouns not be used for (person). No problems with that. Sorry for the mini rant._____Sharing my sexuality isn't the same as sharing my sex life. Sharing a sexuality involves just that person, whereas sharing the sex life affects the partner/s as well.

Would you be happy knowing your mother got ""help"" if she was tormented in her head 24/7?  Psych drugs are not a cure all.  I have a mildly schizophrenic family member who acts out at times, but you wouldn't believe some of the health issues the different medicines caused her - she was in agony.  I would much rather put up with her occasional outbursts and have to care for her than to put her through that again.  If you've ever watched someone you love be affected by these psych drugs, you might not be pushing them as much._____Not being in danger doesn't mean you aren't uncomfortable as hell.  My husband caught a very bad stomach flu from me and was vomiting and in pain for days (eventually went to the doctor).  I was with him anytime he needed me, and yes, I missed a lot of sleep.  But he felt miserable and I wanted to comfort him, because that is what married people do.  You know, the whole ""in sickness and in health"".  Not, I'll support you if your sick as long as it doesn't interrupt my sleep.  Hell, my husband supported me long term when I was sick a few years ago and was at my side through thick and thin, losing sleep for months on end, and working every extra hour he could to pay for it all, and he was at my side during every hospital visit, no matter how long I was in the ER.  I guess I just have a really strong marriage and a great spouse.  Lucky me!_____no, antidepressants start changing a persons brain the day they start taking them.  It doesn't mean they are helping in any way.  Withdrawal happens not only when a person is addicted to the substance.  Anything changing a person's brain can cause withdrawal, whether it is a helpful or harmful drug.  This article talks about how lexapro is already changing the brain chemistry within 3 hours of dosing.

There have been people who started on an antidepressant, felt no benefit, and when they tried to go off a couple of months later they ended up having a breakdown.  When the brain tries to readjust itself after coming off of these medicines, some people's brains adjust right away and they have no issues, others are fine in a week, but others have long term issues while their brain tries to restabilize itself.  This is why a person who tries an antidepressant to help with work anxiety or something can end up having a complete breakdown or become suicidal when trying to come off of it, even if it didn't seem to be doing anything._____ - there is nothing wrong with going to the hospital, you did what you needed to take care of yourself. That being said, people only go in to mental health units when things are severe.  Being that it was that close to the trip, the time change and stress could have retriggered another episode, even though you thought it sounded fun.  If you were that bad off just 2 weeks earlier that you needed to be in a hospital, it is completely justifiable that the school wouldn't take you on the trip - if something happened or you suddenly went into an episode again, then what?  Do you really want to end up in a psych hospital in barcelona?   Plus, with self harm there is always the chance you could accidentally go too far.

It sucks, but if there was no way for the school to get the money back, it makes sense that they didn't refund it.  If I were a school principal, I would not take a student who was jut in a mental hospital on a cross country trip, much less a trip to a whole other country._____ - I would report it because with an attitude like that, he may fail to provide proper care to the patient.

Getting good grades now can make a huge difference in your future, especially if you want to go to college (I understand that is not for everyone.  There are some great trades out there, too, where you can do year long program and get certification for something).  But there are so many kids who scrape by in high school then never bother to do any other additional learning who greatly regret it 10 years later when they aren't making good money and are living paycheck to paycheck. 

Also, maybe talk to some of your teachers at school (even if your dad goes with you) to see if there is any help available.  I don't think your father expects you to be a straight A student, but if you are failing many classes, that really is an issue.

Your boyfriend is wrong. This guy publicly wished gang rape on a girl for being drunk. This guy ends up being someone who is responsible for protecting people in the club and the club itself. Post public comments under your personal facebook, knowing what a viral comment can do, you deserve backlash. Take the screen shot, post it to Twitter/fb/ig tag his employer. If it takes off, watch them get demands from people all over the country demanding he be fired. Hell, I'd even post reviews on Maps and Yelp mentioning the comment and his name. 
This guy is dangerous. Especially in a position like this. _____ for being OK with helping him cheat.
Guessing by your English that  you don't live in the same country as me. It may not be as serious there, but here it can be automatic fail.  He's cheating on the test, not you.
Anyways. You'd be the asshole for agreeing to help him cheat. I'm not good at math. I studied my ass off and still passed. If he's too lazy to study that is on him. You offered help. He copies your answers,  the teacher sees or notices the same wrong answers,  you BOTH fail._____
You can dislike him for being a prick without being homophobic. People jump immediately to sexism, racism, and homophobia so easily these days. Yell at a little black girl. Must be racist. Tell a man or woman they're wrong. Must be sexist. Dislike a bad person. Must be homophobia! All three of them are bad, but when we default to it, we do a disservice to the cause._____
That's an abuse of power. He's a power hungry asswhole who has no respect for people who he deems as not good enough. To admit he lied to them and then laugh about them crying,  he's a sick evil bastard who will one day hopefully be fired before he destroys more lives. Get him to tell his story again. Film it. Post it to YouTube. Watch him get what he deserves._____He's not addicted. In the OP'S story,  he calmly shut off his game and went to help after playing for under an hour, and another time he told her that he'd be happy to do something  else, but if not he was bored, so he'd game instead.

For those people, ""I just can't"" really means, ""I just won't"" and their ""mistakes"" are not really mistakes. Even unintentional misgendering causes tremendous harm and I consider people who do it repeatedly to be assholes.

This is the part of your response I was referring to and I'm sorry but I interpreted this as you expressing that no matter what in your opinion if someone is making mistakes in gendering a trans person, no matter how they are handling a specific situation they are an asshole and therefore the asshole. We all have to remember that when people making mistakes is not always terrible behavior and can come from a place of confusion and unfamiliarity. Yes it's true many people can be failing to put consideration into their words and this is hurtful but you have to recognize that for a lot of older generations this is totally foreign territory here and they're bound to make mistakes while trying to figure it out. Doesn't mean someone is denying someone else's identity but maybe they are confused. Regardless this isn't the point of my post and I didn't mean to bring up a hypothetical that would upset anyone. I only wanted to say that there are so many possibilities for a situation and we need to look at more details than just the trigger issue :)

My experience is irrelevant but if you want to know I am an alternative education teacher who teaches students in a setting outside of mainstream due to various reasons individual to each student. This is basically one-on-one teacher-student lessons for two hours a week per subject. I have had multiple trans students struggling with puberty and transitioning and for me I see it as easy to use someone's preferred pronouns but then again I'm very open-minded and accept people for whoever they are and for me that means making an effort to respect how they would like to be spoken to. I was living for while in an area thats pretty homogenous where lots of teachers grew up in that place and the older generations had been pretty sheltered from most LGBTQAI culture plus raised religious. Before our first trans student entered the program (who was ftm at the beginning of their transition with a female name but preferring male pronouns, entered into our program due to avoiding regular school classes) I saw how worried and confused a few of the older teachers were about how they should handle this trans person (they didn't understand how it works but also wanted to provide a safe environment for the student and be respectful). I saw and heard others use wrong pronouns multiple times with him and then realize and immediately apologize profusely - these people were hardcore Catholics who were out of their league with this kid so they made mistakes but they made a real effort and owned their mistakes. Yes it was cringe-y and awkward but it improved; they got better and with other students were better at this. I think if your intention is to be respectful and you're doing your best, you're not automatically the asshole in whatever situation. Anyway this is separate from my entire point in my original post which was hey consider intentions and behaviors specific to a situation._____I'm not saying all details are irrelevant or only specific ones are relevant, just that we need to be careful.

Also I don't mean to offend with that example, but your response is kind of proving my point - you are automatically taking one side of an intentionally extremely vague hyppthetical due to personal bias and trigger. My point is that both people have feelings and are doing actions but we can't blame one person or the other just solely on the basis of commenters' personal beliefs towards the LGBTQAI community and no other facts. I don't really want to debate that but I think you are reading too much into what I said. You can't claim someone who makes mistakes is always denying a trans person's identity just because you are pro trans; you have to look the details of the story in every case. The hypothetical was left open enough to mean that depending on the situation, which can WIDELY vary, there are a variety of possible judgments - any of the four could apply depending on what happened. Maybe they have made a mistake twice in a month or maybe 20 times in one day or somewhere in between. Maybe they are apologetic or maybe they are uncaring about the mixup. This would show a different level of respect and intent. I left this open in order to make a point that just because you feel a certain way (supportive) doesn't mean you can just give the coworker a free pass. Maybe the coworker got upset enough to punch the other person in the face five times for making a mistake twice or maybe they just politely corrected the person. These details matter. You have to look at behaviors and intentions of both sides and not just react based on your trigger (I am not taking sides btw and I think it's great you are standing up for your son and trans people.)

My whole point is that you can't judge just based on the fact that someone made a mistake or just that someone is part of a group that is often highly discriminated against. You have to look at what's happening: like I said the behaviors and intentions of both sides. There are certainly times when one will be TA or the other or both or neither but to simply say one side is always wrong for making a mistake or always wrong for getting upset and not base your judgment on any other relevant details is reductive and doesn't provide judgments that are as productive._____I feel like you are kind of making my point for me. The way you put it, that would be providing an answer irrelevant to their questions. The ways of reacting you describe contradict the purpose of this subreddit, which is to provide a fair judgment of a specific situation. In order to provide a fair judgment you sometimes need to put aside your emotional reactions to certain parts of the story in order to focus on providing a helpful answer.

Let's use the abortion example. 

If someone asks if they are TA for not telling their partner they are getting an abortion, it doesn't matter how you feel about abortion. Because the question isn't ABOUT abortion, it's about a decision made related to abortion. Comments like "" - Your body, your choice!! Get the abortion regardless of how he feels about it!"" and "" - How dare you kill a child?? Consider adoption!"" are both equally unhelpful to answering the OP's question. 

The point is that people are focusing on the morality of the wrong part of the post. If you have extreme beliefs about abortion (or whatever other topic is being covered) and will believe OP is TA for getting one no matter what and you are unable to get over this when deciding whether they are TA for not telling their partner, then you should refrain from commenting and move on to the next post because you aren't providing relevant, fair feedback to the actual question.

My whole point is that we often disagree because we have a variety of morals/ethics/beliefs/values and it's great to get a variety of opinions because it can be really eye opening. The different perspectives are what make this subreddit so useful for people looking to get others' takes on a situation they are unsure about.

I think I might have given the best example in my reply to another commenter about the circumcision post - see that for the whole thing because it's too much to type out again._____Of course! I think you made a really really good point with those posts and I too get bothered by how people are so quick to judge based on one detail, often when the detail isn't even really relevant to the specific question answered. 

For example, I answered a post earlier where OP said they are disgusted by the idea of slightly older women finding him attractive and mentioned he realized it when he went to a nightclub and got hit on. I got slammed because i said OP was the asshole for being disgusted (I thiught it was age-ist; like no one would defend it if OP was disgusted that another race hit on him or abother male because that's racist / homophobic but somehow age-ism is okay?) and everyone thought I was defending that the women who hit on and touched him was okay, which had pretty much nothing to do with OP's post/question or my response. It's just a distraction and incorporating the details of some overly touchy person's behaviors into OP's judgment was utterly irrelevant and messes with the integrity of the sub.

Your example is even stronger - finding evidence is irrelevant to the action itself and to the okay-ness of the action, but somehow people think it changes the validity of the action, which is the wrong way to make an honest and fair judgment. The integrity of the judgments is declining because of the fickleness of fixating on certain details that shouldn't be considered when rendering judgment.

Lol please do make a meta post; if you don't I may because what you've proven has been bothering me for a while. Thanks for the thought experiment :)_____ - honestly people should care about the quality of the human beings running, not ONLY what their phenotypes are. I think the more diversity we have in our representation the better (and clearly gender and race end up meaning mkre than just phenotype). but you can't just be against candidates because they are white/male... they are being unfairly reductive and close minded.

They are the ones being kind of unfair in my opinion and Im a total feminist and all about equality for everyone no matter who you are or where you are from (we're all just citizens of spaceship earth). I agree with you that its sad people actually only want to elect based on one aspect of someone (for example my boyfriend's dad kept telling me I should have voted for Hillary clinton in the democratic primaries SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE she's a woman and so am I... which is unfair in my opinion). I think that they way overreacted and attacked you... you didn't seem like you were trying to be a jerk at all..._____I'm sensing sarcasm 🤔 lol

Actually though close family friends have two severely mentally retarded children and I have seen how much it hurts the mom when people use that word flippantly so I'm a bit on the PC Police side of this from personal experience. I get it though words shouldn't have so much power... But the reality is they do for a lot of people.

Plenty of fathers are lazy deadbeats who later want to have relationships with their kids. Trying to hold people's abortion decisions against them for life is gross. Your daughter is allowed to want whoever she wants in her wedding, and she's allowed to be 'best friends' with her bio mom.

test	suggesting my wife we put off big plans( having a baby and buying a home ) till we are financially stable	"Things DO happen, and if you have nothing to fall back on, things go downhill fast, often leaving you with no way out of debt, and things just keep avalanche and build.  I bought a condo a couple of years ago that was well within my price range (we only used my income, I wasn't married yet).  After owning it a year, the maintenance fees went up, my insurance rates went up randomly, and this past year I got a notice that our condo was just appraised an it increased in value over 15%.  This means that my taxes will now be 15% higher.  In just a few years, my monthly payments are a few hundred more than what they were when I bought the house.  If I wasn't with my husband, I would have lost the place that I could easily afford myself just a few years earlier.  I have also been informed that some of the roofs are leaking and we may suddenly get hit with a thousand dollar or more repair for the condo association.

If you've ever watched someone you love be affected by these psych drugs, you might not be pushing them as much._____Not being in danger doesn't mean you aren't uncomfortable as hell.  My husband caught a very bad stomach flu from me and was vomiting and in pain for days (eventually went to the doctor).  I was with him anytime he needed me, and yes, I missed a lot of sleep.  But he felt miserable and I wanted to comfort him, because that is what married people do.  You know, the whole ""in sickness and in health"".  Not, I'll support you if your sick as long as it doesn't interrupt my sleep.  Hell, my husband supported me long term when I was sick a few years ago and was at my side through thick and thin, losing sleep for months on end, and working every extra hour he could to pay for it all, and he was at my side during every hospital visit, no matter how long I was in the ER.  I guess I just have a really strong marriage and a great spouse.  Lucky me!_____no, antidepressants start changing a persons brain the day they start taking them.  It doesn't mean they are helping in any way.  Withdrawal happens not only when a person is addicted to the substance.  Anything changing a person's brain can cause withdrawal, whether it is a helpful or harmful drug.  This article talks about how lexapro is already changing the brain chemistry within 3 hours of dosing.

There have been people who started on an antidepressant, felt no benefit, and when they tried to go off a couple of months later they ended up having a breakdown.  When the brain tries to readjust itself after coming off of these medicines, some people's brains adjust right away and they have no issues, others are fine in a week, but others have long term issues while their brain tries to restabilize itself.  This is why a person who tries an antidepressant to help with work anxiety or something can end up having a complete breakdown or become suicidal when trying to come off of it, even if it didn't seem to be doing anything._____ - there is nothing wrong with going to the hospital, you did what you needed to take care of yourself. That being said, people only go in to mental health units when things are severe.  Being that it was that close to the trip, the time change and stress could have retriggered another episode, even though you thought it sounded fun.  If you were that bad off just 2 weeks earlier that you needed to be in a hospital, it is completely justifiable that the school wouldn't take you on the trip - if something happened or you suddenly went into an episode again, then what?  Do you really want to end up in a psych hospital in barcelona?   Plus, with self harm there is always the chance you could accidentally go too far.

It sucks, but if there was no way for the school to get the money back, it makes sense that they didn't refund it.  If I were a school principal, I would not take a student who was jut in a mental hospital on a cross country trip, much less a trip to a whole other country._____ - I would report it because with an attitude like that, he may fail to provide proper care to the patient.  What if he refused pain medication or something for the patient because he felt he should suffer.  I would report him instantly!_____and going through physical therapy and surgery causes pain, but sometimes they are needed.  Cleaning an infected wound can also cause pain, so lets leave it and die of infection instead.  Chemo sucks and makes people sick, so we shouldn't let doctors give that, either?  If the kid has an infection under there, it would be sore when the doctor puts medicine on it."	care:7,loyalty:1,authority:1,sanctity:1_____sanctity:3,care:4_____care:5,sanctity:2_____care:4,authority:1,loyalty:1_____care:4,authority:2_____sanctity:3,care:3	0_____0_____0_____1_____1

""Take advantage of going out""? What does this even mean? Is she a chained up pet that you take out on walks? You use this phrase multiple times. FYI, it's ok to feel rejected and insecure without having to demonize your partner for living life. They're an adult, they don't need you to set a curfew, and yes, it's YOU setting the curfew, not ""if WE don't try something, they'll continue to take advantage"". FFS, you don't sound like you trust your partner at all. And yes, you're being controlling if you can't deal with your partner staying out a little later than planned because they're having fun. You frame this as you being worried about them being ok, and yet even when they text you and you know that they're ok you obviously still want to make this about them ""taking advantage"" of the fact that... what? You're sitting at home refusing to go to sleep? That's your choice, not theirs. 

  I don’t even like doing this as it makes me feel like I’m monitoring their comings and goings but if we don’t try something, they’ll continue to take advantage without self awareness or admission.

So yeah, you wanna control them AND feel good about it, but you can't have it both ways. ""I don't wanna do this but you're making me"" is the language of abusers. If you don't wanna feel like a controlling jerk, don't be a controlling jerk. Setting a curfew isn't making them ""prioritize your relationship""; it's you telling your grown ass adult partner how long they're allowed to stay out and have fun without you. At least be honest about it instead of trying to pass it off as worry. 

In an ""ideal world"", as you say, your partner lets you know that they'll be a little late, and you say ok, thanks for checking in, have fun babe. And if you get jealous and insecure, you work on that on your own or with a therapist, without disguising it as worry or a relationship priority thing or them being an evil ""taking advantage"" person. And if you have trust issues with this person, either address it in a healthy manner with a couple's therapist, or break up. Restricting their life will only make them resent you and it's obviously making you dig in your heels in justifying your controlling behavior. _____  I feel like im not trusted with any of her problems.

She's allowed to have an inner world without you. People like this are healthier than people who tell their SOs every tiny little thing. Don't make her issues about you. She's allowed to not trust you with her entire existence if you've only been dating for such a short time. What if it's not a family issue? She can have an existential crisis or a stupid worry that she doesn't want to share. She doesn't need to justify that. Your job as a boyfriend is to support and respect her, not demand that she give up her secrets to you because she owes them to you now.  if you continue with this attitude._____. That guy is disrespecting her agency by acting like she doesn't know any better and he can sway her no into a yes by simply harassing her and wearing her down. Borderline creepy. You, in turn, are the violent asshole boyfriend that physically injured someone simply because you felt threatened by them when you could have simply trusted your girlfriend to stick to you. Both of you are treating the girl in the middle like she has no voice or agency of her own, like she's some animal you have to either coax closer or keep away from predators by punching things. _____Let's break this down. What do you fear will happen? That she will like him back if she spends more time with him? If you have that little trust in your gf, you can choose to work on that and keep trusting her, or break up. Do you fear that he'll make advances at her? People who don't have feelings for your gf will do the exact same thing. 

It's ok to be insecure, but  because you actively ""take it out on her"" by being ""cold and mean"" and ""man child sulk"". What do you hope to accomplish with this? Make her coddle your insecurity forever until...what? You understand her circumstances and yet put her between a rock and a hard place because you don't want to manage your own emotions. This is not a grown up partner behavior, it's child behavior to a mom. What did she do to deserve mistreatment? Trust you and be honest to you enough to let you know that some other guy has confessed feelings. This is going to teach her never to trust you to be adult about your own feelings, never to be honest about her social relationships with you, and that having a man child as a partner is exhausting because she WILL have more people in her life have feelings for her and she doesn't deserve to be punished by her bf for it. Choose carefully.
_____. 

Admit it, you're not worried for her safety. You're not a karate black belt and the concert is not a gang activity. You're just jealous and controlling, and dishonest about it. 

Also, not wanting to go out with her so you can punish her for not obeying you makes you an emotional abuser. Break up and grow up._____. She's an asshole for minimizing your pain, and you're not an asshole for being uncomfortable. But people being obligated to ""stay away from"" people you dislike isn't respect; it's submission and control. Don't be like the bully.

You can choose to control only your own actions, e.g. stay away from Liza. Not telling her to stay away from your ex."	fairness:3,care:2,authority:3_____care:2,fairness:3,loyalty:1,authority:1_____care:5,fairness:1,authority:1_____fairness:3,care:2,authority:1_____fairness:1,authority:3,care:2_____care:2,authority:4	0_____0_____0_____1_____1

Your wife was going through a serious medical procedure which kills an astonishingly large number of people. After evacuating a human from her body, you had the Gaul to think of your sexual pleasure over her health. I doubt the doctor was laughing at your amazing unique wit (sarcasm here), he was probably laughing because he knew that nurse was going to rip you a new one. Trust me, NO ONE thinks “the husband stitch” is funny. I think the nurse probably understood the seriousness of the matter more than you do. I am actually very glad that your wife took the jokes well, because if she didn’t, it really could have had a long lasting negative impact._____Yta. That’s unnecessarily cruel! Someone is taking their time to show that they love her. Her notes aren’t hurting anyone at all, not bothering anyone, and are frankly none of your business.

I’m not sure if you’ve asked her to make a public apology, or just one in private to you, but it seems she is dug in, and won’t give up. I guess at this point, the reasonable choice is to be the bigger person, and let it go, but you can also choose not to participate in this situation again.

This seems like mainly a communication issue.

You are clearly the primary caregiver. It sounds like you are a very detail oriented and organized person and you have a specific way of doing things with your child. He is only minorly a caregiver so probably when he comes over, he feels useless or doesn't know what to do so is waiting for your lead.

I remember my male friend explaining to me one time that there is a big difference in the ways males and females handle ""helping out"" and I know this is a pretty big generalization but I've talked to a lot of people who said he was pretty on point. (Disclaimer - Obviously this isnt true for all males and females but I have noticed a trend and my relationships with people work out better with both males and females because I try to keep this in mind in my interactions.) 

As a female, you want him to step up and offer to do things or just do them without asking. That is what makes you feel valued and respected and it it how you feel he should contribute. You want him to see what needs to be done and do it or at least try to figure out what he can do to help without you having to ask.

It sounds like your boyfriend maybe takes the more common ""male"" approach which is to allow you to do your thing without interfering with you or your routine because he may not want to get in the way or mess with your plan for things? He also is not the primary caregiver so he doesn't really know exactly how you want things to be done so he is waiting for your direction or requests and sees this as respecting you and your autonomy.

So I guess just communicate with him what you want. Tell him you want him to take a more active role in child care and explain to him what needs to be done so in the future he can make you happy by stepping up and doing it without promoting. Maybe he needs to take the child for a night or two on his own to get better into the more of being a more involved parent?_____I would definitely say he is body shaming you (idk about fat shaming because I don't know if you are fat, but personally I find 'body shaming' to be a broader umbrella term that I like more). He is also being abusive and malicious FOR SURE. There is no reason to antagonize you with insults and name calling, ESPECIALLY when you are minding your own business doing nothing wrong and hurting nobody.

He sounds like an emotionally abusive man with bad values. Some people are just miserable inside and they won't be satisfied and won't rest until others around them are just as miserable. If you want to 'win' against him do your best to not show him upset feelings (it's what he wants), just calmly express that you are disappointed he is behaving this way. And DO NOT answer to or even acknowledge these nicknames. Pretend like he isn't talking and if he gets mad say ""that's not my name. I will not answer to an insult."" He will try to pull the ""im only joking card"" but he is not joking he is bullying.

Sorry he is being such a jerk. I have a family member who is antagonistic like that and sometimes it's not even their words that get me upset but the fact that they are okay with being so mean/disrespectful to me in the first place like they have judged I don't deserve niceness. We all deserve respect and nice treatment and I'm sorry your uncle can't see that. Avoid him as much as you can_____

You are being passive aggressive and lying. It's okay to feel jealous but you told him one thing (it's okay and you will get over it) when really you feel another way and you expect him to magically read your mind and give you what you want. Grow up, tell him how you really feel, and communicate together to resolve this.

And it's really petty of you to bring up some dumb rumors of this girl ""cheating on her boyfriends and selling sex"" in order to character assassinate her. That shouldn't be relevant to the way you handled communication with your bf. 

Plus you mention that you are already super insecure around other females it just makes me feel like you need to stop being so judgmental and passive aggressive towards everyone. Not everyone is out to get you and steal your bf :)_____

May be unpopular but hear me out.

If you don't feel like having sex, that's totally fine, but be honest about it. Don't make up excuses and lies. 

He doesn't understand? That's because you haven't communicated it and you haven't given him the chance to come to an understanding. You are taking the path of least resistance and instead of working together to communicate what's going on, you'd rather not deal with it and instead just make up an excuse.

He is pressuring you and not liking your answers. Not cool. This seems to be him not communicating well either. Instead of communicating his frustration in a healthy way he makes snippy comments. To be fair to him, I'd be upset if my SO was lying to me as well and it seems like your lies are starting to be weak excuses._____

He's not treating you with care or respect. He only cares about his own sexual satisfaction and whatever he needs to say to coerce you into giving it to him. That says a LOT of bad things about his character and you should reconsider your reasons for being with him. You deserve to be treated better than this_____To be completely fair you need to stop having an emotional affair as well. Physical isn't the only way to cheat. You should stop contact with the man you are into now or else it's basically just you looking for a free pass to step out on him.

Sure asking might be hurtful but at least it would mean you being honest with him. Open relationships are what some couples want/need and if works for you guys, it works for you. Might also want to consider couple's counseling to help work through a lot of these feelings and desires and the dead bedroom problems you seem to be having."	care:5,authority:2_____loyalty:1,authority:2,sanctity:1,care:2_____care:1,fairness:3,loyalty:1,authority:1_____loyalty:1,fairness:3,care:1_____authority:2,care:2,sanctity:1_____care:2,fairness:3	0_____1_____0_____1_____0

I absolutely understand that you can't take the cats in - but saying things like ""This isn't constructive to her wanting to better herself"" is borderline .  Yes, she should absolutely get out of the abusive relationship, but I understand her mindset of not wanting to leave the cats behind (especially if the abusive partner has threatened harm to them, which many abusers do if they think they can use the threat to control the person they are abusing).  That doesn't mean your fiance's sister is trying to take advantage of you - It's just the abused victim mindset._____ (your Mom, however, is definitely an asshole in this case, IMO).  

If your sister truly wants your mom to stay out of the delivery room, she can tell the hospital staff as much and your mom will be banned from the delivery room.  My brother and his wife gave birth back in December and at this specific hospital, they had to give a list of preapproved visitors so that anyone who was NOT preapproved didn't get an id tag (The maternity ward required an id card to enter, it remained locked otherwise 24/7).  They could at any time revoke the ID card by telling a nurse (who I'm assuming would escalate it up the chain of command to whomever handled that, presumably security).  

If your Mom doesn't learn to respect her daughter in-laws wishes, she may rapidly find herself banned from seeing the baby at the hospital altogether - and your brother may join her if he doesn't support his wife (Yes, the one delivering can absolute choose to have the father banned from the delivery room too)._____

Your daughter SHOULD learn to manage her time

BUT

This ain't the way to go about doing it.

  ""this is a hill I'm willing to die on""

Are you also willing to sacrifice any relationship you have with your daughter or any chance of her coming to you for help in the future? Because that's what's going to happen.

My Dad tried that ""You need to learn to manage shit on your own"" routine too - so when a situation came up when I really could have used his help, I just kept hearing his ""no, you're on your own"" speech replaying in my head and was too afraid to approach him for help. 

That's the kind of ""fear"" you're instilling in your child when you say ""No, you're on your own, I'm not helping you.""._____

You should divorce your wife and leave this family alone.   First of all, that's such a fucking scumbag move on both your part and your sister in-law's part.   It's an incredible betrayal of trust to do it even once - but now you're wanting to leave your wife for her sister???

Great, so not only will your wife (ex-wife?) have to live with the knowledge that you fucked her sister and frequently fantasized about her sister while having sex with her, but she'll have to see you all cozied up with her sister at all future family functions/holidays/etc.

_____Good plan.  Luckily, when it came to my brother's situation, our Mom was chill - but his MIL was not.  Speaking to the nurses/doctors/coordinators at the hospital to have a plan in place definitely helped sooth any fears they had about someone showing up and starting a ruckus.

I'm glad to hear your SIL is madly in love with your brother - but this is a highly stressful time.  Her comfort in this case is more important than not ruffling the feathers of someone who can't accept that no means no._____  ""She is 25 years old and not even trying to help herself""

That you know of.  Unless you're up her ass 24/7, you have no idea what she is doing.  Regardless, at 25, I was completely disabled by panic disorder, depression, and agoraphobia.  Maybe your sister in-law is really struggling with mental illness and is, in fact, NOT the lazy piece of work you're making her out to be.

  ""What if they get into an accident?""

Okay, using your logic, you're never going to be able to let your husband drive your children around regardless because what if they get into a car accident?

I get that it's scary and you're concerned about the safety of your husband and child - I really do.  However, car accidents can happen anywhere at any time.   Even if his sister is NOT with him, he could still wind up getting into a car accident taking your son to a doctor's appointment or something.  These things are horrible, but they happen all the time - It's not your sister in-law's fault if they happen when she's with him.

  ""is this an indication that I will grow resentful over time if she's not contributing and still controlling?""

None of us know your future, but I know that if I was the primary breadwinner and my partner tried to dictate what I would or would not do with said income (outside of reason - obviously bills would come first, I wouldn't frivilously spend, y'know?), I'd get pretty fed up after awhile.

No, you're not - or you wouldn't have gotten upset that they didn't offer to pay the full amount.

I'm glad to hear your SIL is madly in love with your brother - but this is a highly stressful time.  Her comfort in this case is more important than not ruffling the feathers of someone who can't accept that no means no._____  ""She is 25 years old and not even trying to help herself""

That you know of.  Unless you're up her ass 24/7, you have no idea what she is doing.  Regardless, at 25, I was completely disabled by panic disorder, depression, and agoraphobia.  Maybe your sister in-law is really struggling with mental illness and is, in fact, NOT the lazy piece of work you're making her out to be.

  ""What if they get into an accident?""

Okay, using your logic, you're never going to be able to let your husband drive your children around regardless because what if they get into a car accident?

I get that it's scary and you're concerned about the safety of your husband and child - I really do.  However, car accidents can happen anywhere at any time.   Even if his sister is NOT with him, he could still wind up getting into a car accident taking your son to a doctor's appointment or something.  These things are horrible, but they happen all the time - It's not your sister in-law's fault if they happen when she's with him.

It's so easy to dump on another person for not wanting to care for a cancer patient without jumping in to help instead. And I'll tell you, I nursed my mother through cancer for over 6 years until she ultimately died, and I am very lucky that I had the means and wherewith-all to do that, and it's helped me deal with her death, but it pretty much sucked the whole time. Obviously, I would do this for my mother because she was my mother and an awesome one - but I can't imagine I would do it for a partner of 4 months.

She's incredibly selfish  (Sounds like my ex wife)  I went through the same thing, only i do work a desk job, but  i ended always putting the baby to bed, getting up at night any time the baby cried, getting up in the morning with the baby,  and work was my ""break""  too 

  

beef warrior has some great points, btw! 

  

there's 2 aspects to this though,   the possible Bi-polar behavior and that your wife is incredibly selfish.     if you want to try and stay with your wife,  you need your own therapy , so you can find that middle ground of not an ass and not a door mat.  and you will need couples therapy . 

  

Your story is the exact start of my 5 year marriage..  at this point i wish i would have gotten a divorce long ago.    when you're a push over, and your spouse is selfish , it CAN lead to all sorts of problems.  child neglect , cheating, spending a lot of money.. etc  (yep i ran into all of those) 

  

i really want to tell you to run like hell (metaphorically speaking, you should in actuality co-parent your kid 1/2 the time and live in the same city as your baby mama)  , but you should try and work things out with your wife for at least 6 months,  as you do have a child together. _____ - and thanks for sharing.    not in your case its better to not share with your mom since its going to damage what little trust you may have left in her.    guidance counselor at school maybe,  close long time friend, your dad ? 

  

\bad idea\ record yourself asking her not to share your private conversations with her, specifically mention its hurtful.     next time she shares one, post it to her face book.     she will stop, really fast.       chances are she won't have the introspection required for this to be an ""ah ha"" moment..    and instead she'll just be mad  that she looks like a bad parent publicly._____ - please don't talk to the help,  next thing you know they might feel like your equal. 

   in all seriousness ,  you are too kind hearted to have proper social etiquette in that circumstance.   they pay her to clean so they don't have to.  she's not hanging out with friends or family she's doing a job.  yes its very weird (probably not if you're used to it) but that's just how it is.  

  

kind of like if i take my car in for some work, they really don't want me to take off the tires.  even if i routinely do that at home and i feel weird standing there doing nothing._____ -  she should not be at work with pneumonia .   

all forms of  pneumonia are contagious.        even fungal based can be spread.  

  

its not as if her body spontaneously created the pneumonia.  

  

Yes there's a window where all of the bacteria (fungi, virus) is dead and the body still has its immune system working ,  extra mucus , coughing, etc.      But you really don't want to accidentally get someone sick  who has a compromised immune system, or a small child._____ -    Don't sign the birth certificate,  and technically this was rape,  because you didn't consent to unprotected sex.       you could go as far to file a police report,  which would help you a ton if she takes you to family court.    there's no way a DA is actually going to prosecute her,  so its sort of a win - win if you do file, as you'll have a police report.  

  

while its best to ignore them,  you could respond to her family and friends that call you a dead beat dad that she's a rapist.   (calling each other names is bound to fix things /Sarcasm)_____ -     yes if a good close friend of mine got injured I'd want to help and make sure they are okay, I'd go and visit.  

  

you said she has family there ,  2 weeks?   and now you need extra time?

Your comment might have been harsh, but was completely justified considering what he was saying. Even if it wasn't the case, you admitted you were out of line and apologized.

You're GF has made up her own rule and is imposing it on others.  It's a small red flag that she won't follow social convention.

She’s right, if you want a gourmet meal cook it yourself. You made a promise, there were no conditions. However, asking her to be more involved in planning the kitchen is fair.

Stalking doesn’t have to be constant contact over months or weeks. Your behavior is still harassment even over years if it’s unwanted, imo.

Think about your brother or mother dying, and their friends don't show up. That hurts. A funeral is a day to honor and remember someone who was lost too soon. No matter your grief, you suck it up and you go. No one is suffering more than that family,  and they deserve the support._____Your SO needs to butt out. Your family was all on the same page, and he barges in with his opinion that you're all rude to not include the mistress? No.  if you include her just because your SO pressured you. There's no drama now, everyone is united in how they feel. There's no need to change that. What they  suggested will create drama. She is not a part of the family, and she willingly cheated with a married man. She's as bad as he is. Maybe in time this will pass, but he cannot honestly that now. You already said you don't respect him or like her. You already talked to your parents. Stand by what you feel._____.
You say you loved the ring. It symbolizes your love.
But now you're embarrassed by it because you think people will view you both as poor because your friends have bigger rings. Not only that, but instead you wear bigger family rings.
You are definitely the asshole for bring so worried about the opinions of others and compatible yourself to them, that you're hurting your husband._____
Anytime you fight and she cries, you bend to her will. You’re a doormat. You’ve done this to yourself. You’ve not only been her doormat because she’s spoiled, you’ve also gone on past vacations without saying a word. Speak up for yourself and tell her you can’t afford the vacations no matter how much she whines and cries. Work in a backbone and do not marry this girl. Can you imagine her wedding expectations?? You’ll cave and next thing you know it’s in Barbados and you’ve paid for an ice swan and plane tickets for her entire bridal party to attend and the bachelorette party._____No need for passive aggressive sarcasm. One more time. I know people who have had perfectly acceptable weddings well under 5k and everyone was happy. Not everyone wants a fully catered event, and it's insane to claim that if you don't do this or that, your own family and friends will ""hate you"" for not having an elaborate enough affair for them to attend. It's not their day.  I've been to 2 backyard weddings, a few in churches. For the backyard, they rented chairs, bought some flowers, and had an official. There were no issues with the bathrooms, and they parked in the street like normal people. For the church, the pews come free with rental of the church. Add flowers. Add a photographer to both. A wedding is maybe an hour long max.  You also don't serve anything at a wedding. That's the reception. which you do not need, and do not need to go all out for. Two of them very inexpensively rented a local bar for drinks afterwards, no dinner, and they brought a cake. Family and friends got to dance and chat and drink, and they all had fun. One rented a hall. A few table cloths, a few flowers, a dj, a small buffet and cupcakes. That's it. Well under 5k. The most expensive wedding I went to was 8k, and they had it in a hall with music and even a photo booth. It is still well within the OP's right to feel a wedding is stupid without someone guilting him.  When you struggle for money, having a 12k wedding is also very stupid if you can't afford rent for the next year and need to take out a loan to cover living expenses._____.
Your parents are forcing you. That isn't the fault of the church or the pastor or priest or whoever. It's terribly bratty, disrespectful, rude, and immature to do this. It tells him you aren't interested, but he has no idea you were forced to come. Be discreet,  use headphones that are cordless and under your hair or a hat.  Don't text.

OP had things to get done and was doing them, then caught up with a friend and was comforting her in a time of relative need.

Heres another example: I work at a restaurant. People on their phones while im trying to hand out food or get refills and talk to them? Rude as fuck almost ALL of the time. That in mind, I'm in an area heavily affected by the Nor Cal Camp Fire. Thousands of people have lost their homes and been displaced. One lady last week was with someone and was on her phone the WHOLE time. Her server told me she'd barely been acknowledged by the lady and the person she was with did all the ordering, though they were both polite just stressed. We found out when it was time for them to pay that she was on the phone with her insurance the whole time trying to sort out details of the loss of their home. (Unrelated, we did comp their meal and take care of them. Not because of any annoyances we felt or prejudgements made, but because it was the right thing to do).

Now, that's an extreme example and comparison, but OP was on the phone with his dad discussing holiday and other adult issues, then comforting a friend with her issues. I don't think theres anything wrong with that as long as their voice was at a respectable level.

TLDR?: Despite the final decision of asshole. I don't think OP is an asshole. _____.

_____  she's trying to manipulate you,  instead of  validating your feelings of wanting a safe space   comradery,   She's trying to paint the activity as sexist,  in order to get her way. 

  

Wanting to hang out with only your male friends Is not a hateful act.  nor is it an act out of feeling superior or inferior to women.   Its about wanting a safe space.

  

No Impass.    You can cook steak,  drink whiskey and smoke cigars with your GF on a date night,  or a mixed couples night,  or any night you guys want.      And you can still have a guys night.  

  

If she needs to be with you 24/7  I'd suggest (first just an honest conversation)  or perhaps a book or some couples therapy_____,  i think in a lot of cases (abuse, controlling , lying, cheating,  etc)  its best to  not be friends and not have continuing contact.

your friend is right, you have no right to be mad at her .

  

you not caring about your BF's feelings , just about getting off, does exactly mean you don't get to be all high and mighty about other people not caring about yours, and just wanting to get off. 

  

i know ""everyone is the hero of their own story, in their own mind"" but shit lady, what kind of mental gymnastics did you achieve where your ex-friend was in the wrong but you were in the right?  how the hell ?  

  

you should be a defense lawyer for terrorists, murders and rapist,  they need someone who can explain away terrible deeds and paint them as the real victims._____ - unless you think this guy is immoral / a terrible person (if so .. why are you friends with him?) 

  

  Its very natural to want to protect family members , and no one wants to think about their siblings hooking up.    but you're just gonna have to sit on this. 

  

Still though if it makes you really uncomfortable you could stop hanging out with that friend.   your sister and your friend get to make their own decisions, etc.   But so do you,  if the situation is really crappy for you, you don't need to wallow in it.

She may think she loves cats, but she's a huge asshole and an idiot who is hurting her own cats. 
I worked rescue for years.
1. She's endangering your cats. Fleas can leap off. Eggs can lie in wait. Your one cat is especially vulnerable.
2. She's locking up your cats, which isn't fair to them. They then have the smell of foreign cats in the house which upsets them.
3. The above scenario can also cause them to start spraying urine out of confusion or concern for marking their home as theirs. YES, even neutered males and altered females. They can spray all over the house, and once they start in cn be almost impossible to get them to stop.
My cat growing up started spraying due to the cat next door coming into our yard.
4. These poor cats are let in, then tossed back outside. She's not helping them. She's teasing them. If she really wants to help, she can buy flea treatment (NOT collars or cheap Hartz or pet store drops!!).
5. She's exposing your cats to fleas, worms, and feline leukemia -which is 100% fatal. All it takes is a fight or exposure to cat feces.
Tell her she's teasing these cats and playing with them like they're toys, the tossing them back outside. If she wants to help, she can be responsible and vet and foster them and find the new homes, try to rehome them, or she can help them get into a no kill rescue. But if she's not willing to actually help them, she needs to leave them the fuck alone.
Speaking as someone with rescue and veterinary experience,  some are ignorant to just how careless, heartless, and dangerous and inconsiderate this is to those cats and yours. And for me, this would be a deal breaker. I'd pack my bags and leave if she refused to use her brain. You may end up with fleas you have to spend hundreds to remove from the home, and you may end up with a cat behavior urinating in your entire home. She needs to wake up._____
Your parents made a commitment to the dog by bringing her home. Leaving her sit with a bloody oozing sore is absolutely not humane. They did not know she would be fine, and waiting too long is what often makes cancer not treatable. Had they acted much sooner...
At the least, she needed bandages and dressing to clean it up. Hell, buy a damned cone for a few dollars. Would they let a child sit with a bloody oozing sore for days, much less weeks?
Then they lied to you about their neglect. They lied about the appointment. They didn't need to have a biopsy either. It was the right thing to do, but just dealing with the pain and infection was the bare minimum. 

You did the right thing and they shouldn't have pets._____You need to take a deep breathe and calm down. If other opinions bother you to this extreme, maybe the Internet isn't for you. You also need to read some of these stories in this very sub where animals vanish and are overnight rehomed or dropped at animal control because the partner wanted them gone. Every week it happens. That's dangerous to the cat. Maybe he leaves the door open. Or throws something at it. Also in this sub are roommates and partners hitting and neglecting pets. One roommate was hitting her dog and scaring him so badly he was peeing himself...and yes she let him stay. Another boyfriend was neglecting the dog. So yes it is possible and it literally happens all the time in this very forum. If it broke out of the carrier, it was not secured tightly. If you know anything about pet carriers, the metal bar does not let you force your way out. She did not check to see if it was working properly. Anyone who has a cat and takes it outside will double check the door for safety. It is tough because she doesn't want him to hate her cat and have trouble looking at the creature that murdered his pet every day especially as he already disliked the cat. That's why she lied. Not for fun. Having the bird fly out the window leaves her looking irresponsible and in the wrong, but it protects him from hating her cat. I didn't say it was right, I said it was tough because her lies came from a place where she was in between a rock and a hard place, and the truth would hurt everyone involved. I did not say she was in the right. I agreed with the handful of others who said that tight or wrong, the truth wasn't going to change anything and she was in a tough situation. Hopefully you didn't scream at all of the other people with this opinion. Sometimes you need to calm down and agree to disagree. It's a part of life, and being an adult._____YWBTA.
Animal control is no joke. If they don't pick her up, she could be put down for space in 4 to 7 days.
I get how you feel. They are assholes. She could be hurt, kidnapped, killed by bad people. She us leaving dead things on your property.
If your AC isn't a facility that kills for space, then I don't see an issue. But odds are...
There are laws against cats on private property though. 
I'd look into your area and maybe ask around with local no kill rescues to see what you can do without putting her in danger.
You don't need dead animals on your porch. I'd be upset myself. It can get messy._____ IF you speak.up to the farm or the police. She,sounds spoiled and entitled, but she didn't just steal some headphones. She stole  ANIMALS from their home. That's really selfish and shitty. Sure, say nothing, she will get worse and end up in prison. Step in now and the animals are returned and she gets wake up call.
If I kept quiet in this case, where these poor owners are wondering if their animals are ok, I'd never be able to live with myself or sleep at night.  You know, just like the people who has their animals stolen. You shouldn't either.  At the LEAST, contact the farm and tell them where there animals are. If sister won't tell you, tell her you will go to the cops. Your sister isn't just a thief.  She's a monster. How would you feel if someone stole your dog? Stay quiet,  YATA and your sister will end up in prison.
If your parents are weak and they spoil her as much as it sounds, they will be useless in stopping her or doing anything useful. Remember this moment when you decide to step in and do the right thing or let them ""handle it"". 
Third option. Tell her she gets those animals returned or you call the police right now. That is the very least you can do, and it removes her getting in trouble. The very least. _____

It’s fine to have working dogs, but you have to actually take care of them if you commit to keeping them. It’s not like they’re wild animals invading their space. They are using them for work, and as such, they are their responsibility to care for. I’d use cows as an example. Not pets, but they are domesticated and dependent on the humans keeping them for work and profit. If your cow gets sick, you don’t just let it die. You have to ensure it’s being treated properly; food, water, and shelter that isn’t too cold or too hot to survive. It’s not like a raccoon living in the beams who brought himself there and is responsible for himself as a wild animal. They need to alter/spay the dogs as well to avoid ending up with 20 of them or becoming a back yard breeder peddling out puppies with no vetting for profit.
The cats sound like outdoor cats or barn cats, and in that case, are generally happier outside in a safe environment. But they should alter them, because having 50 of them fighting over food and shelter isn’t a great situation for them.
id discuss this with your girlfriend and tell her that you understand that the dogs are more like livestock to her family, but that they still need to be given care. And the dogs and cats do need to be altered to prevent them from having too many that they can’t take care of and so that they are not competing for limited  resources and fighting."	care:9,authority:2,fairness:1,sanctity:1_____care:3,fairness:1,sanctity:4_____care:4,authority:2,fairness:1_____care:5,authority:1,fairness:1_____fairness:4,sanctity:2,authority:1_____loyalty:1,care:4,sanctity:1	0_____0_____1_____0_____0

you seem to think that bc your wife is a colleague and broke up with him that she had every right to be included. but you guys were rude and hurtful, especially her. you’re just her puppet. 

first, it is rude to bring an unknown guest. even to a networking business lunch. it throws off the expected conversation. it’s even worse to bring an unwanted one. you both seem to think that bc he now doesn’t want to talk to her that he’s still in love with her. ???? no, she represents a dark time in his life and frankly i don’t think your wife is an innocent as she claims. he did not want her there. 

second, no one he’s been stalked/harassed following a bad breakup(which is what your wife is claiming) rushes to make themselves part of a intimate lunch as a surprise. and your wife could’ve arranged a lunch for herself if she thought it was ok, she has a closer connection than you. but she clearly knew he wouldn’t want her there and was hoping the shock would force him to remain. it’s borderline sadistic that she did this 

third, you continue to do a disservice to this guy by saying he left bc he’s still in love with her. if that were true why didn’t the calls and emails to her resume since she shows interest in speaking to him again, even in a professional way? he is enforcing reasonable boundaries with an ex that’s clearly had a negative impact on his life. how does this lie make sense to you, you’re a smart guy. “he’s been emailing and calling so he’s in love with me. and he’s moved away. and now that he’s agreed to meet with you i want to see the guy that said he’ll kill himself over me. oh he doesn’t want to see me or talk to me now. he still loves me. it’s too completely opposite ends of the spectrum how do they mean the same thing to you? 

and using his lack of marriage as proof that he’s not over her? maybe he’s dating someone, maybe he was busy with research and work, maybe your wife did some serious emotional damage and he’s working through it before a serious relationship. maybe he doesn’t believe in marriage and has a long term partner. 

in any case, your wife messed up and is using this incident to feed her ego. even if he’s not still in love with her, you both still messed up._____. 
and op i think it’s time you accept your place in his life.

you ARE NOT HIS FRIEND. you are his EXWIFE. those two facts will never change. you are now at best an acquaintance he tolerates. 

but this needs to be accepted bc here is how it will play out and it is playing out.

he is placing normal, healthy boundaries. you keep pushing against them, trying to reestablish the emotional connection from when you were married. bc you weren’t friends for a decade, you were husband and wife, and that’s far more intimate. unfortunately, your lack of understanding this core concept is what imploded your marriage in the first place. 

you are pushing and people will be forced to pick sides. your friends, who know that he has a nice wife, who has always been respectful will begin distancing themselves from you. because they don’t want the drama and disrespect you bring. you pushing these boundaries will have him permanently cut you off, not bc he has a controlling spouse, but because you don’t respect him. 

and finally, your bf will end this relationship when he realizes how obsessed you still are with your ex. 

you had what sounds like an emotional affair. the marriage is over. you lost him. you are only allowed as far into his life as he allows. i’m telling you, try to cross that line one more time and i’m sure the gates will come down and you’ll be cut off forever._____. He’s gaslighting you. It’s not manipulative to be upset that your bf keeps ditching you for someone he has romantic feelings for. Of course, you’d be upset, it doesn’t sound like he understands that he violated your trust and that it is inappropriate for him to have romantic(sexual desires) for someone and hang out with them excessively while he’s in a committed, closed relationship. And it sounds like he cheated and lied “didn’t but wish he did”, which contradicts everyone saying he did and he wants to cheat on you. He’s keeping you on the back burner while he chases after her. The fact that he’s threatening to break up with you over this so you don’t complain or ruin his time with his side piece is manipulation. He’s the asshole(look at this relationship, it doesn’t sound healthy for you)_____ for wanting to protect your friend. But you need to stop and think. This could have unwanted repercussions for your friend that makes her life worse. What if he convinces her to marry him(with this abuse won’t be hard) or convinces her to come to Germany with him taking her away from her support system? Just because he has to leave the country doesn’t mean he’ll leave her. You’re still in a position to help your friend while she’s here. I wouldn’t recommend doing this. _____yta. not bc you couldn’t control his behavior. you know why you couldn’t predict his behavior? because you’ve only known him for a few weeks! yta bc of your poor judgment, who brings a new person they’re dating to a family event when you didn’t know how it would go. and you could’ve done a lot more to get him to leave. for one thing, the second he started you should’ve stood up, apologized and demanded he leave so your family could enjoy the rest of the show without his presence. it would’ve been a scene, yes, but poor phoebe wouldnt have been humiliated. be honest, you wanted to show off what you thought was a great guy and bc of his background you didn’t cause a scene to protect your family or dump him_____Nta but i want to comment on the final edit. you booked marriage counseling. marriage counseling is therapy for the relationship.
is the relationship a problem or is he and his viewpoint the problem? marriage counseling won’t be counseling for him with you helping him, that won’t work. 

he’s said multiple times he won’t change. the one key part of any therapy is an openness and willingness to change. otherwise, again, it’s a waste of time and money and won’t work. 

at the end of the day, the only one capable of changing him is him. doesn’t matter if you’re in therapy with him, reminding him of the work, scheduling the appointments for him. if he doesn’t want to, it’s a lost cause. 

what actions can you take to make you happy and respected? bc you can drag him to therapy but you can’t make him listen or change."	care:7,sanctity:1,loyalty:1_____sanctity:2,authority:4,care:1,loyalty:1_____fairness:4,care:2,sanctity:1_____care:2,authority:1,loyalty:1,sanctity:1_____care:1,authority:2,fairness:1,loyalty:1_____authority:1,care:1,sanctity:2	0_____0_____1_____0_____0

 I asked him to wait until I'm better so we could have KFC together,

which will possibly be never. you will quite likely have to avoid fatty foods/trigger foods forever, even with it being gone. mines been gone for 5 or 6 yrs now. i still get sick from too much fatty stuff. the only real difference for me(admittedly i also have a gut disorder so that can magnify things)is the pain and nausea is not near as strong as before the removal. you can not ask him to forgo this stuff forever._____!! there are other sources of protein other than steak, dude. tofu, eggs, cheese, lentils, etc. it sounds like he might want variety in his life. are meat and starches your food staples?? i know i loved eating at my grandparents because they had real fruit, veggies and treats that weren't just PB toast. home foods were nothing but french fries, KD, pizza pockets and hamburger helper. if all you eat is meat and potatoes he might just need more flavourful things. it won't harm or kill your son to have a few veg meals a week._____!! i know you're all trying to do this because you care but this is his battle to fight and win in his own time and fashion. you can't force an adult to eat(or live)in the way you deem they should. you won't win and you risk losing your brother from your life. you need to back off and let him live and eat how he chooses, even if it is detrimental to him. he needs to be in control of his stuff. infantalizing/parenting him will push him away. if you really want to help talk to him about seeking help with his mental health first. he needs to conquer the demons in his head that make him cope by eating._____!! you are the one on the diet, not him. he can not be your will power to eat healthy. that has to come from within you and only you. you have to learn to be around temptation and say no, not control others food, especially in the home they help pay for. he can support you in many ways without having to be miserable(food wise at least) in his own house. i'm all for people losing weight, i need to myself, but it's no ok to ask everyone else to follow or cater to your particular diet to make that happen.

also, are you doing this weight loss under the supervision of a doctor?? the bigger you are the faster you will lose weight at first but 160lbs in 6 months is a lot of weight. make sure you're doing everything ok and truly healthily so you don't harm yourself."	authority:1,care:3,loyalty:1,sanctity:5_____fairness:3,authority:3,sanctity:1_____loyalty:1,authority:1,care:2,sanctity:3_____care:4,sanctity:2_____care:5,authority:1_____authority:2,care:3,sanctity:1	1_____1_____1_____1_____1

if op does either of your suggestions, they become an asshole.

op, you’re . but this is an unfortunate situation you’ve found yourself in and can’t really remedy. let’s say your ex didn’t get another place to live. you’d be stuck living with him until one of you move out and you don’t get to decide that it’s him. this is just one of the risks that happen when you move in and share a lease. it’s a bad roommate situation that you have in an extremely stressful time, and you can of course ask him, his parents to move out sooner but my recommendation is to focus on the end goal of 5 weeks and dont tiptoe around them.

tell him you need your bedroom and the parents have to move out of it. i’m pretty sure they’ll leave after having to sleep on the couch for a bit. it’s actually even better if it your bed(not one he bought). point out their messes, do what you want in your home to make you comfortable. 

it depends on how comfortable you are with it, but playing loud porn on a daily basis will quickly make them uncomfortable and the idea of a bright sunny townhouse will be more appealing.

also the reason why the washer and dryer is important is bc your ex is planning on having his mom do his laundry if she’s not already. and he’s such a good son to not want her to risk death doing it._____. Tbh you’re taking too much of her bs. If you’re in a high living area, you can find another single roommate, there’s probably high demand. I can understand her not wanting you guys to shower together(is that shampoo or..) but she took it too far. She doesn’t get to dictate where you guys are or if you’re in a bathroom together. And make sure you put in the next lease agreement their requirement to clean up, bc her reasoning is insane. There’s more of you so you should clean more? Each person cleans behind themselves. And the thing over the bedrooms is insannnnnnnneeeeee. Two people get the bigger room, especially when they’ve already paid more. Don’t pay for her to break the lease. Have a conversation with her and then start putting all her mess in her room and if necessary really enjoy your showers now(noises etc). But I’ll admit I’m an asshole and this would be an asshole move._____honestly, . if she told right after she found out, yeah that’s not right. but for all you know she told the THIRD time she knowingly dealt with someone pissing their bed in the same room with her and fifth time overall. that’s disgusting. no one should deal with that silently ESPECIALLY when you make no effort to change. 

btw people will know about this. i was an ra for 3 years. requesting a roommate change usually leads to them trying to mediate first. or at the very least they’ll come to her for her story. she will tell them that you piss the bed consistently. you may be charged cleaning fees or for a new mattress since they can’t really expect someone to use that same one soaked in your pee. and they’ll talk to you about your habits and how to improve them. if this continues to be an issue they can kick you out for destruction of property, underage drinking(assuming you’re in the us), and poor hygiene causing a health risk. 

basically stop drinking or you have the serious potential to ruin your life, getting kicked out of dorms._____lollllllll

And you do owe her. Legally, you owe her. It’s too petty and amount to go to court over, but yes if your dog damages someone’s property you are liable. And don’t judge her for her shoes bc it sounds like you have cheap taste. Someone got her a gift of expensive shoes and your dog ruined them.

After , that number should be Zero.    (unless you two broke up for a while and got back together)

you might be in an abusive relationship (polyamorous / open / gas lighting)  and your brother is trying to protect you.     maybe he doesn't have the tact and verbal communication skills to do so in a gentle way, but this sounds to me like he's trying to protect you (feelings, time, etc)

OK, I can see how that seems like a logical conclusion, but the stats don't seem to support it. there was radical societal change in the 60s and 70s, from total repression to greater permissiveness, and the (stereotypically self-involved) baby boomers went a little nuts. Divorce rates have been dropping steadily since the early 1990s too - as have crime rates. Or maybe the craziness of the 60s and 70s really was due to pervasive lead poisoning from leaded gasoline as some people surmise? (The Freakonomics guys have also proposed a theory that the legalization of abortion in the 70s is what's lead to lowered crime rates in the 1990s - but I feel like the widespread availability of birth control is even more likely). There are a lot of things that contribute to widespread societal changes.

 And I think open relationships promote that sex isn't awd big of a deal. Always normalizes getting married and having sex with people outside of the marriage.

I don't know if I agree with that necessarily. The way people approach sex is always going to be a personal thing - influenced by society, obviously, but there have always been people that didn't feel like sex should be such a serious thing. It's OK for sex to be just for fun, but the most important thing is to know how you, personally, want to approach it and are able to approach it - are you a person that can have casual sex and not get hurt, or not? Neither one is better than the other, but it's paramount to know yourself. 

for some people, sex can be a casual thing, but that doesn't mean that their sense of ethics or morality is impaired. Cheating is about ethics. It's first and foremost about lying to someone that trusts you. To me, that suggests that the message that ""society"" should be pushing isn't that sex should be sacred, it's that you can choose how seriously (or not) you approach sex, as long as you're scrupulously ethical about your behavior, and you're fully prepared for the possible consequences of it (babies, STDs, etc)._____of course not. I've met men and women that love anal. I think OP's experiences with it have already been traumatic enough that she doesn't want to give it another chance, and I don't blame her in the slightest. 

But if you want to get into a real fight, let's go: I do think that the VAST majority of men have learned everything they know about sex from porn, that only a small fraction actually do the proper research about anal, AND I think that the majority of men (yes, I will stand by this) have trouble taking women seriously and respecting their sexual boundaries. _____

 men shouldnt have to pay full child support if a woman wants the child even if the man doesn't. 

I'm just going to completely sidestep the ""males rights activist"" part of this and address the view itself. Human biology is deeply unfair in a lot of different ways. Men cannot control whether a woman gets an abortion or not because that is a medical procedure that only the patient can consent to. If you don't want to pay child support, be VERY selective about who you have sex with, and be VERY careful about wearing condoms. And call your state and federal reps to encourage that more government money go to research into birth control._____

people lie to doctors SO MUCH. You would absolutely be the asshole if you reported her for making sure you didn't want the pap. she was trying to protect your health. also - you can get exposed to HPV even as a virgin._____

 It may sound childishly-silly but I simply don't like the idea of dating, or marrying a man who had other woman before, I wanted to share my first time with another first-timer, or none.

But yes, this is absolutely childish and silly. People have histories. Someone being a virgin doesn't mean they're going to be a good partner, and you should care more about whether or not they're a good partner._____

IDK, I'm wondering if she was upset thinking you'd had unprotected sex? But sex with condoms doesn't protect against every STI.

The person that give the recommendation to the professor, the professor asked for feedback. Maybe he was a little too passionate and drones on, but your professor probably appreciates that more than silence.

this is a complicated situation. But be really honest with yourself - how would you deal with this if this was one of your parents?

Also, this conversation:

 A few days ago I was at a bar with my friend and discussing my true feelings about the entire situation. The bar was a little loud so I did have to speak up a little bit in order to hold the conversation. I told my friend that I’ve been feeling inundated with these bills ever since the the midpoint of the treatments, and again, although I have put on a smile and want the best for my Wife’s family, internally I wanted the financial bleeding to stop and just wanted my mother in law to die comfortably in hospice care. 

Were you diplomatic and considerate? Did you say anything that could have been misinterpreted?_____

OP, what the fuck?

 I love our life together and don't ever want to risk anything.

So why are you lying to your husband so you could go ""help"" this stupid piece of shit? You literally risked your marriage by:

 letting my boredom guide me into a making a bad choice to having a screaming match in the mall to not telling my husband what happened.

What was the point of that? Don't give time and energy to abusive assholes. To understand why, listen to the ""Dirty John"" podcast. 
_____

 everyone we know except for a few are calling him the asshole for not accepting and being pissed at her.

Seriously? Cheating is cheating, regardless of who she cheated with. 

Do you guys live in a vastly more repressive country than the US currently is or something like that? a hundred years ago I would have had a lot more sympathy for a gay person married to a straight person but in most first world countries people can either be out or just not get married..._____ or , I think. I can understand being upset that your brother stays with someone that cheats on him to this extent, but it sounds like you were seriously trashing this woman before her cheating became known:

 He got married to a woman whom I thought was a terrible match. She has two kids from previous relationships by different men. And she doesn’t work either. And she buys things on amazon constantly.

God, what horrible bitch, having kids and buying things on amazon. Your brother can marry anyone he wants, and how did you think trashing her would go? 

Now, of course, you have new information._____ IMO even if you decided to meet your needs elsewhere without her blessing, you would still not be the asshole provided you were honest about it. I'm not sure you'll be happy about the results of that decision, if you made it, but asshole isn't the word I'd use.

I do disagree with you there - knowing she's not open to an open relationship, he should divorce her before cheating. _____

It's OK to not pity someone for experiencing the consequences of their own actions. I'm not sure what he expected when he told his wife he didn't love her anymore? Divorce is generally what follows.

 everyone we know except for a few are calling him the asshole for not accepting and being pissed at her.

Seriously? Cheating is cheating, regardless of who she cheated with. 

Do you guys live in a vastly more repressive country than the US currently is or something like that? a hundred years ago I would have had a lot more sympathy for a gay person married to a straight person but in most first world countries people can either be out or just not get married..._____ or , I think. I can understand being upset that your brother stays with someone that cheats on him to this extent, but it sounds like you were seriously trashing this woman before her cheating became known:

 He got married to a woman whom I thought was a terrible match. She has two kids from previous relationships by different men. And she doesn’t work either. And she buys things on amazon constantly.

God, what horrible bitch, having kids and buying things on amazon. Your brother can marry anyone he wants, and how did you think trashing her would go? 

Now, of course, you have new information._____ IMO even if you decided to meet your needs elsewhere without her blessing, you would still not be the asshole provided you were honest about it. I'm not sure you'll be happy about the results of that decision, if you made it, but asshole isn't the word I'd use.

I do disagree with you there - knowing she's not open to an open relationship, he should divorce her before cheating. _____

It's OK to not pity someone for experiencing the consequences of their own actions. I'm not sure what he expected when he told his wife he didn't love her anymore? Divorce is generally what follows.

That's not at all what she said or what he said. 

 My wife is saying that I get one on one time with our son and this is an opportunity for her to do the same. I think it is a good idea for her to bond with our kids one on one too.

She claims she wants to go alone because she she wants time to bond with the mentioned son, despite having 4 days off a week alone. Not about the other kid who was only mentioned in passing.

Yet she's not even going with them alone. She's also going with her friend and her friend's kid/kids.
 
When dad goes, it's after work or weekends, and he also must take both kids.

She admits the friend actively discludes him on a regular basis.

 Every time this friend wants to get together with my wife, she never wants the family to be included. It's always dinner and drinks with the girls, beach trip with only the kids-no husbands allowed and now, she wants to my wife to bring our son to Legoland for the weekend and I am not permitted to go.

  I asked her if she could name a single one of my friends that makes her feel excluded and unwelcome and she can't. She recognizes that her friend always wants it to be a girls only or no husbands type of deal but justifies it as ""I don't have very many friends I want to hang out with.""

What speaks about her character is that she says it's unfair she he takes the child in question to the zoo and beach and she wants time with him too. But she has 4 days off! Dad is spending time with him after work and some weekends. He has 2 days off. What speaks about her character is that due to him being upset she's going without him, she calls him names and tries to make him feel like a villain. He says he just wants her to understand how he feels. There is zero evidence he's controlling or an asshole. All we have to go on is what he tells us. Making up plausible scenarios isn't going on the facts we have. So we can only say ""based on this, I feel this."" Logic based on given facts.



_____
Your wife ""won't work"" and here you were working 7 am to midnight, and she's not only refusing to do laundry, dishes, and clean the bathroom, but she expects you to do it at midnight?? You were working two jobs for her lazy ass. Now you finally work one job, and you come home and make your own dinner and take care of the kids. Not together. Just you. While she stares at the t.v and you rub her legs? if she had a job, you'd both be responsible for taking care of your kids after work.
You are a doormat who has done this to yourself. She's a lazy hypoctite. But you let this happen. You have been working yourself to death rather than stand up for yourself. Guess what?  If you divorced her, she'd need to get a job. Stop letting her walk all over you._____He is working 12 hour days and coming home to take care of the kids after. She has a nanny taking care of the kids for almost the entire day and refuses to help him get sleep to rest for a potentially dangerous job. At this point she could easily still work outside the home. But this is a waste of my time . Not interested in arguing with people just because they don’t like differing opinions or who think the wife gets a pass because she gave birth. Enjoy arguing with everyone you disagree with._____.
Your wife seems very damaged, but she took her family's side after they made it clear they didn't care about her. Your FIL is behaving on a paranoid and insane way. I'd honestly cut off all future contact. Yourself and any future kids. Tell your wife now that you don't want your kids around them.
Curious why you didn't report them to the church. His behavior is toxic. _____
It’s the multiple failed businesses that changes it from . 
She said she got to make the financial decisions because she made more, and he accepted it. Now he makes more and he said it’s only fair he gets to decide. She called him an asshole and cried. While the decisions should not be only one or the other, they should be BOTH, he accepted it when she disagreed. That makes her unfair and a hypocrite. He should not have put up with her controlling financial decisions and telling him it’s because she made more, but he agreed to it. Making her the asshole for being a giant hypocrite when the tables turned. He put her through multiple failed businesses, but it sounds like she never used that as her reasoning, which is a little odd. In the end he cannot be the only asshole because he is doing exactly what she did._____
She shouldn’t have been trying on her clothes. She had no business doing that.
However. You seem more concerned with giving your kids a mother, and that’s not really fair to her. You should marry her because you love her and can’t imagine life without her. Yet you tell her she can only put her clothes in the closet if there’s room with all of your deceased wife’s clothes in there.
Grieving has no time limit and you absolutely should feel free to keep her clothes as she left them for as long as you need. But at the same time, you can’t bring in your new almost wife and tell her she can’t have closet space. 
I’d say you aren’t ready yet. Give yourself and your kids time to adjust to life without her, and move your new partner in when you are actually ready.

You've  read about the parents where there child kills someone,  and you wonder how they didn't get that child to someone who could handle them before it happened.  Your life is a nightmare.

 You asked him out on a date to make him feel better. You had to work late just to be able to make it. 12 hour days plus school. 
1. He invited his friend on your date.
2. He went early without you.

5. They ordered dinner without you
6. You asked to split the check and he bullied you into giving in.
7. $170
8. You drove them home.
You didn't have a date. You paid for their night out and then you were their driver.
You must be the kind of person who is weak and people use and abuse them. He knows this. He abused this. Then he made you feel bad about calling him out. 
I've dated some guys who weren't great,  but no one has ever treated me that badly.
Please please dump this user. You can do so much better. He's a complete piece of shit. 
_____ for having dinner at a set time and set plans,  for the way you handled it.
He's already eating once. He may eat twice depending on if he ""feels like it or not"". He isn't coming for dinner. He's coming to visit. So you could have told him to come over at 6 for dinner, or after dinner at X time to visit, and that guests will be leaving at around X time, after which you will clean up and go to bed or go shopping. Where you'd mention that at X time it's too late because you're tired and have to work the next day.
 If you have dinner at 6, and he shows up at 9:30 and expects to stay for a while, that's terribly rude and inconsiderate of him if you have to clean up and go to bed to be up for work. 
He is not with the mother of his kid, but he's basically being her driver and picking up her kids and taking her where she needs to go. He already has dinner plans with mom, which is fine, but then maybe he'll have dinner with his ex's grandma as he drops her off. That could have him walking in at 9 as your last guest is leaving and you're doing clean up. 
You should have said, we are eating at X time. We are putting away food around X time. We plan to clean up and go to bed/go shopping at X time and do not want guests late because of this. If you are available before X time, please stop by, otherwise we'd love to see you Saturday for leftover pie.

You owe her an apology and maybe try having a conversation about how you were hurt by what she said. But right now, you're the bigger bully and asshole in the situation._____Like I said before, everyone handles trauma differently and it's important not to judge. Now, for this girl in particular her accident could have been the WORST thing that's EVER happened to HER specifically. For others, a car accident or getting hit by a car is just something that happened a couple years ago and they're not affected by it at all. Could she be faking? Absolutely. Some people like the attention that their pain brings and like to milk that shit for all it's worth (have family members like that, it's GREAT to deal with /s ). That said, it's not your place to make that judgement or call. Also. Y'all are in the tenth grade. Some tenth graders are just full on dramatic. And let them be dramatic.

But mental illness is not a thing to be internalized and ignored. Talking about it normalizes it. Normalizing it helps people realize there's nothing wrong with it, as long as you seek medical care when or if needed. It sounds like talking about it MIGHT be her way of coping. _____ for a lot of things, mostly for being so condescending and ordering those for her when she has shown NO interest in being able to do pushups. I'm about 110 and cant do pushups, but at work I carry large and fairly heavy trays of food regularly, then fill that tray full of dirty dishes and carry it back to the kitchen. I'm capable even if I cant carry my body weight. 

What you SHOULD have done was TALKED to her. Unlike your gf, I want to be able to do push ups so I've started a routine. Weights aren't even the easiest place to start for building core body strength. Wall push ups are much better and then you work your way down to the floor. You bought her something she didnt want and didnt ask for and dont her why shes mad. That's a dick move._____ and I'd find a new therapist 

I'm someone who has trouble controlling how loud she is. I come from a very loud family and I also work in a restaurant where I need to speak very loudly to be heard in the kitchen. Sometimes its hard to remember to talk softer. The reminder doesn't make me ashamed, it makes me go ""aw fuck my bad ill do better"".

That's not fucking how eating disorders work, educate yourself so you understand. As per your edit, it just proves you're a far bigger asshole because that changes the WHOLE story from ""my roommate is stealing and replacing my stuff!"" to ""my roommate has a serve eating disorder"".

it’s you AND your wife’s wedding. meaning you BOTH make and agree on the rules. you do not get to be a little dictator and ruin the event. do you really think your wife hadn’t seen her friend except for the wedding, that she wasn’t aware of the piercing? of course she was, and that’s why you blocked her from seeing your wife. bc you wanted to be the boss and punish her friend and your wife. you want to destroy their relationship and i bet you were hoping there was a season. bc then you win by making it look like she’s overreacting or you win by forcing an ultimatum on your wife to cut out the friend.

and depending on the placement, type of piercing, and when she got it, that piercing may not be able to be removed. 

the thing is  but you don’t care.
you still think you’re right and don’t care how your actions affect others. i’m not going to say what you are bc it’s painfully obvious but in the end your behavior is predictable. i give this marriage a year until your wife breaks from the cycle of treatment you give her._____Yta and an embarrassment. I don’t care if this is the only play group you can find, this is a professional event for her. Her employers, future employers, references, colleagues EVERYONE from her industry is invited. 

Last time, you got drunk and embarrassed her. It is not appropriate behavior to sing drunk, maybe at your work place it is, but not for her. You don’t get a second chance to prove you’re an adult, especially when you’re making plans with the same idiots from last time.

You put her career and future at risk. This was incredibly selfish and stupid of you. If you really wanted to hang out with these guys, you could arrange another get together, not humiliate your girlfriend and disrespect a clear boundary she set. 

You need to apologize, accept the full weight of your actions, swear you’ll never interfere in her career again and follow through. Bc if it was me and probably a lot of other ppl, this relationship would be over._____Yta. I’m not familiar with this festival, but unless it’s also a massive fair, i don’t think there should be children there at night. And if she’s able to take shots, there shouldn’t be children either. Basically no kids should be there after 7. If random families make bad decisions to bring their children in an adult atmosphere, they don’t get to say watch your language, please wear something else. 

Why are you trying to parent them? There isn’t a single festival I’ve been to where there hasn’t been drunk guys shirtless. They didn’t ask you for a dress code, why are you telling them what “is and isn’t appropriate for the group”? If it’s not illegal, avert your delicate eyes._____. and for reasons besides the whole going out in a pandemic stupid decision.

first, it sounds like the plan was to go with his daughter and spend time. you chose to come along. so no, you were not invited as a babysitter bc they already had a plan to be there as a father and daughter.

second, what did you think the plan was? i’m really confused by this. he said he was going to do landscaping and then play. did you plan on going there and helping with the landscaping and then playing? or to just go, do nothing, and then play? and you are an adult, why didn’t you take into account your hunger anyway when you joined this outing? because wouldn’t you get hungry/thirsty working and then playing outdoors? 

and you wanted to spend time “with all three of us”. so why were yo not prepared to spend time with his daughter as well? i get not wanting to be the babysitter but were you then prepared to pitch in with the physical labor instead? 

tbh, it seems obvious to me that if you’re invited to a group outing where there’s work and then playing, you need to do some sort of work. you wouldn’t just sit and wait until everyone is done. and if he went with just his daughter, i’d assume they’d all keep an eye on her, maybe give her small tasks, bc again they were going without you anyway. i think the issue is you had poor expectations and saw this as a low impact afternoon bc your bf “is not athletic”. 

he was going to watch his daughter with you there or not, that’s what a parent does. but when you invite yourself to a communal work activity(and play), you’ve got to expect you’re doing some sort of work._____Nah. I’m sorry you’re going through this. And it’s important to understand that your family cares for you and is afraid to lose you and while you’ve somewhat accepted your fate and grieved they haven’t yet. A counselor/therapist will help. I think it’s two separate issues, wanting to “give up”() and wanting to travel and for the rest of the time(Yta). It’s fine to decide your fate, but make sure you don’t leave your family blindsided. Before you make travel plans make plans for your funeral. It’s something to solve before you die to make it easier on your family. Look into the cost of burial plots($$) or being cremated, make sure there’s a will, maybe make notes/letters/videos to say goodbye. And i don’t think spending the rest of the time traveling is a good idea. It could be a financial and emotional burden on them when you’re gone, especially if they’re not traveling with you, they’ll need to say goodbye and have memories. Again, sorry for what you’re going through._____Yta. I understand what you’re saying, you want cute kid time vacation. But if it’s a family vacation, she’s your family and has to included. Otherwise you will seriously damage your relationship with her, her father and her relationship with her siblings(your twins) if you keep excluding her. At most, plan a vacation that she attends part of before she goes back to her mother(so the trip covers both custody times and she leaves half way through. Then you still have some time with the twins. But you really need to work on your relationship with her and general understanding, i recommend a therapist specializing in family issues.

This is exceptionally hard to figure. 

If I were in your shoes and had no other children, I think I would get a divorce. I’m extremely open minded with this sort of thing. I have 6 kids. If I found out later on down the road that one of them wasn’t mine, I would blow it off and keep trucking. That’s assuming that my wife was in agreement that I, I was the father for all intents and purposes and bio dad was out of the picture. 

That’s not what you have here, however. What you have is a woman who got pregnant via an affair, and has maintained contact with the bio dad (on the sly) ever since. 

The truth came out, and you left. Instead of her trying to rebuild the relationship and more importantly, rebuild trust, she’s ramping up the shitty behavior, to the point of inviting this guy into your marital home. That’s the biggest example of disrespect I’ve seen in a long, long time. 

Even if she and the side dude are at odds and he’s asking to see his kid, do it in neutral territory. 

I think these situations go one of two ways. 

1) the truth comes out, and the non-bio dad steps up. The fact that he is moving past an affair, and raising the product of said affair as his own, causes the woman’s respect for him to go through the roof. 

2) the truth comes out, the non-bio dad steps up, and the wife loses every shred of respect she had for her husband. 

I think you have the latter unfortunately. For a relationship to survive infidelity, trust must be rebuilt and both sides must be willing to put in a lot of hard work to move forward. She doesn’t seem to be doing either. She’s doing the opposite. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Almost done. 

So if you’re getting divorced, I’m not sure I would fight for that child given the fact that she is 3 years old and has had contact with her bio dad the entire time.

I think I would jump ship and let the whole damn thing sink. _____. 

My BIL recently got married. My new SILs dad cheated on her mom when she was about 7 and married the side chick. Stereotypical man following his dick scenario. Side chick was a hotter (at the time, not so much anymore) younger blonde woman. 

The icing on the cake was that SILs dad didn't support the marriage because my BIL isn't the same religion. LOL. Ok. So marrying outside of your sect (but still within Christianity) sends you to hell, but abandoning a wife and child is ok. 

Anyway, I never met the guy before the wedding. I never said a word to him or his whore. I so wanted to  say ""hey man, not sure if you're here for the bride or the groom, but thanks for coming"", just to fuck with the asshole. 

  

I'm relating this to your situation (which is leaps and bounds, exponentially worse than adultery) because I've done something similar. You are under no obligation whatsoever to associate with anyone for any reason. Actions have consequences. 

You should forgive, yes, but forgiveness is really for the victim. If you have no hate (forgiveness), then their evil doesn't get inside you and keep you spinning around and around and around. That's the purpose of forgiveness. The purpose isn't saying ""I forgive you"" to someone's face. All that does is give them a pass to keep doing whatever it is that they were doing. _____I’ve been married 20 years as well and I can’t imagine being in your shoes. We haven’t been through this specifically, but we’ve been through some pretty shitty stuff that hits close to this. We were able to overcome it because both sides were all in. 

I don’t know how you come back from this if she has zero respect for you. You can’t make someone be sorry and you really can’t make someone respect you. She doesn’t seem to be all in. 

What was her reaction when you booted the guy out of the house? What did she say? Also, how did you find out? Did she come clean, or did she get caught? 

Edit - I hope you didn’t think I was coming down on you for leaving. What I was trying to get across is that you’ve left (which is completely understandable and quite frankly to be expected) and instead of her freaking out and doing everything in her power to get you to reverse course, she’s exploiting the situation, as evidenced by her inviting this guy into your marital home. 

Edit 2 - this is important. To overcome infidelity is exceptionally difficult. To do that, plus agree to raise a child you know is not yours, is monumentally more difficult. In that scenario, you can never really put it in the past. Your child is a daily reminder of the affair. 

To overcome infidelity, raise a child that is not yours, and openly allow that child’s bio parent to be actively in the picture....I dunno man, I don’t think I’ve ever heard of that happening. Especially when the wife is constantly disrespecting the husband. _____Did he ever get cheated on? That's usually where this kink comes from. 

Anyway, I don't know what to tell you. Leaving your wife/kids for another woman that indulges your kink = extreme addiction. That's no different than getting so tangled up in drugs that you forget to pick your kids up from school. Refusing to reconcile unless your wife indulges your kink = extreme addiction + emotional terrorism. 

This is a kink that will have no end - damned if you do and damned if you don't. Damned if you don't because he'll stomp off like a little baby. Damned if you do because he will only want more and more and more. 

I'd be tempted to tell him that you have a kink that you know he won't go for, then demand that you be able to do it._____. She could get in deep shit with the courts for doing that. In fact, she could lose whatever custody arrangement there is and only get infrequent visitation. Worst case, she could spend some time in jail for child endangerment. 

Communication is essential (ironically) in divorce, and so are boundaries. She's not holding up her end of the bargain on either and is putting her own flesh and blood in danger. You're not the asshole because you can't live your life in fear of what your BF's ex might do today.  

With that being said, if I were in his shoes, I would take my kids any chance I could get. That would be me though, not my new SO. 

  

In other news -

don't just make them true either. You and I both are making inferences. 

Look man, at the end of the day, there are a lot of people who don't want to marry someone who has been around the block. You may not like it, but there's nothing wrong with that, just like there's nothing wrong with not marrying someone who is skinny/fat, tall/short, white/black, rich/poor, pretty/ugly, cool/nerdy, etc. You can tell yourself all day long that prior sexual experience is off limits and no ones business, but OP is perfectly within his rights of consent to ask. It's was a dealbreaker for him and she knew it. She should have told him the truth and let the chips fall where they may. It's was wrong to lie, and it was worse to slide him into marriage based on those lies, knowing that he wouldn't be with her if he knew the truth. This is a perfect example of why the whole idea of ""your prior sexual history is no one's business but your own"" is never going to take because there are people who will consider it a dealbreaker. 

I mean, if you're so proud about your exercising your sexual freedom in the first place, do you really want to be with someone who is going to have a problem with it? Let them find what they want, and you go find someone you're more compatible with.

Its ok to be angry that she is stressing everyone out, but not ok to tell her you want her to be dead.  Imagine sitting in pain, confused about what is going on, yelling because everything is mixed up in your head, and the only people you have in your life are telling you to die.  Even the most caring, compassionate individuals can end up like this due to dementia or disease.  Would you like your family to tell you to die if you got in a car accident, developed a brain injury, and were suddenly ""useless"" as you put it?

i sympathize with op, but your idea of having family members and friends come over to intimidate her ex and his family into leaving is ridiculous and dangerous. op can change the power balance by putting themselves first, making sure they’re expressing their opinion and begin living as though they are by themselves. if this means, loud music, uncomfortable videos, taking back their bedroom, that’s fine.

OK, I can see how that seems like a logical conclusion, but the stats don't seem to support it. there was radical societal change in the 60s and 70s, from total repression to greater permissiveness, and the (stereotypically self-involved) baby boomers went a little nuts. Divorce rates have been dropping steadily since the early 1990s too - as have crime rates. Or maybe the craziness of the 60s and 70s really was due to pervasive lead poisoning from leaded gasoline as some people surmise? (The Freakonomics guys have also proposed a theory that the legalization of abortion in the 70s is what's lead to lowered crime rates in the 1990s - but I feel like the widespread availability of birth control is even more likely). There are a lot of things that contribute to widespread societal changes.

 And I think open relationships promote that sex isn't awd big of a deal. Always normalizes getting married and having sex with people outside of the marriage.

I don't know if I agree with that necessarily. The way people approach sex is always going to be a personal thing - influenced by society, obviously, but there have always been people that didn't feel like sex should be such a serious thing. It's OK for sex to be just for fun, but the most important thing is to know how you, personally, want to approach it and are able to approach it - are you a person that can have casual sex and not get hurt, or not? Neither one is better than the other, but it's paramount to know yourself. 

for some people, sex can be a casual thing, but that doesn't mean that their sense of ethics or morality is impaired. Cheating is about ethics. It's first and foremost about lying to someone that trusts you. To me, that suggests that the message that ""society"" should be pushing isn't that sex should be sacred, it's that you can choose how seriously (or not) you approach sex, as long as you're scrupulously ethical about your behavior, and you're fully prepared for the possible consequences of it (babies, STDs, etc)._____of course not. I've met men and women that love anal. I think OP's experiences with it have already been traumatic enough that she doesn't want to give it another chance, and I don't blame her in the slightest. 

But if you want to get into a real fight, let's go: I do think that the VAST majority of men have learned everything they know about sex from porn, that only a small fraction actually do the proper research about anal, AND I think that the majority of men (yes, I will stand by this) have trouble taking women seriously and respecting their sexual boundaries. _____

 men shouldnt have to pay full child support if a woman wants the child even if the man doesn't. 

I'm just going to completely sidestep the ""males rights activist"" part of this and address the view itself. Human biology is deeply unfair in a lot of different ways. Men cannot control whether a woman gets an abortion or not because that is a medical procedure that only the patient can consent to. If you don't want to pay child support, be VERY selective about who you have sex with, and be VERY careful about wearing condoms. And call your state and federal reps to encourage that more government money go to research into birth control._____

people lie to doctors SO MUCH. You would absolutely be the asshole if you reported her for making sure you didn't want the pap. she was trying to protect your health. also - you can get exposed to HPV even as a virgin._____

 It may sound childishly-silly but I simply don't like the idea of dating, or marrying a man who had other woman before, I wanted to share my first time with another first-timer, or none.

But yes, this is absolutely childish and silly. People have histories. Someone being a virgin doesn't mean they're going to be a good partner, and you should care more about whether or not they're a good partner._____

IDK, I'm wondering if she was upset thinking you'd had unprotected sex? But sex with condoms doesn't protect against every STI.

I find it hard to believe he would treat his own blood grandkids badly. She doesn't want to see her kids hurt by missing out on having a grandfather. If he gets sick... So she needs to give him the choice to open that door...or slam that door shut. He closes it, he is the villain. You close it, you are both the villain.

You did the right thing calling her out in front of her friends. She has sympathy for her abused friend, but not anyone male who is abused? What a hateful thing that is.

 How would she feel if you said an abused woman was ruining a guy's life by filing abuse charges? 

To say that an abused man needs to man up and leave is blaming the victim. She's acting just like the most disgusting of men who would say a woman was ""asking for it"" and high fiving each other.
Honestly this would be enough for me to end it. If a man told a woman he really felt abuse was something to joke about and women should never get help or file charges,  he'd be viewed as a complete prick. No woman in her right mind would date him.

I bet she also thinks men can't be drugged and raped, can't be sexually harassed, and so on._____False. It's really shocking and harmful to see someone attacking an abuse victim for not having the ""right reaction"". I won't use the term clearly because it's too condescending. 
I know exactly what it's like. Exactly. Which is why I know that getting knocked up means that your life is over. You will never ever be free from him that way, and your child will live the same nightmare. Which is why you fight for your freedom. You get the pill or the ring. You get spermicidal strips. An implant. He can't ""not let you"" when he doesn't know. You get good at hiding things. It's survival and you know that a pregnancy means it's game over. Maybe you can't leave now, but you will someday. He tells you its your fault or he turns from Prince Charming to a devil within the same conversation. He makes you think you're crazy. And you know the truth, but in that moment...you hesitate. You're scared. You're angry with yourself because he's two people and maybe, just maybe, the bad one will disappear. But that's insane. You're insane to think that. Maybe he's right. But he's not. And you live day to day, protecting yourself and planning for the day you can leave. Maybe it'd waking up. Maybe it's finding support. Strength. But you know that you can't be stupid or careless because then it's all over. 
So don't tell me ""clearly"" don't understand. Not every abuse victim has the same reaction or feelings. But no matter what she does, she needs to avoid linking them legally for 18 years, and yes it's serious enough to warrant tough love and a wake up call if it's needed to be smart and ptlrotect herself until she can leave._____I mention the part about little girls just so you understand how sick this was. You raping a 10 year old is the same as what she did to you. Hopefully she doesn't work with kids. Because many abused kids turn abuse other kids. You are not ready for anything serious or physical with someone you can't talk to about your past. You already lied to her. That's huge. She can't trust you. If you don't tell her now, or soon, you will never tell her and that's completely messed up. You want her to tell you the truth and trust you, but you already lied. You could have said it was something you will talk about before sex. But you chose to lie. You only have so long to come clean.
You are also not ready for anything before you talk out the rape and abuse with a professional. You were drawn to this girl because she looks like  your rapist. If that doesn't scream professional help, nothing does. How can you be intimate with someone you initially semi stalked because she looks like your rapist, while you are turned on by photos of your rapist that you can't stop looking at. This poor girl, she deserves a normal relationship. Not this mess. It's not right to do that to her. How would you feel if she lied to you and was attracted to you because you reminded her of her rapist. If this is serious, because this is worse than jerry springer. All it takes is putting yourself in the Nicole's shoes and the shoes of a little boy or girl. If you lie someone you would never do this to them. The truth needs to be told._____That's how people grow to resent others who think they can force people to bend to their will. At this point, you refuse to be the better man because of your wounded pride. Not realizing it takes a bigger man to, well, be the bigger man. People will view you as just as bad as him. The man who had such a bruised ego that he banned grandfather from seeing his own grandkids and didn't see how toxic that act was.  Because grandpa hurt daddy's feelings. If your gf accepts being controlled and told what to do, she will never admit how she feels inside. The rest of them, they may not say it to your face.  But it takes a man to forgive and grow up and move on for the better of a family. You extend that branch and he declines it, then he's the asshole.  You slam that door shut, and you become worse than him to everyone involved.   He never forbid anyone to do anything that didn't appease him and his will. Being worse than him because ""he started it"" makes everyone suffer. Hopefully someday you get there._____I'm sorry but WTF? He attacked and abused your SENIOR dog who is sick, and she took his side? Enough to move out for a few days? No. That's a dealbreaker. What a bitch. You need to explain it to her so she understands,  because she clearly doesn't. She can't. No human is that shitty. If she doesn't believe you, the relationship is not worth saving. Never should you accuse a partner of lying about something so serious. Never.
You need to keep your dog out of that house, and can you imagine if you had a baby with her 8 years down the road and he got angry it wasn't playing with him?? Make the truth clear,  and if they call you a liar, fuck them. It may seem small but it's huge. You can agree to disagree on most other things, but this...this isn't a disagreement,  it's a matter of trust and decency.

She's incredibly selfish  (Sounds like my ex wife)  I went through the same thing, only i do work a desk job, but  i ended always putting the baby to bed, getting up at night any time the baby cried, getting up in the morning with the baby,  and work was my ""break""  too 

  

beef warrior has some great points, btw! 

  

there's 2 aspects to this though,   the possible Bi-polar behavior and that your wife is incredibly selfish.     if you want to try and stay with your wife,  you need your own therapy , so you can find that middle ground of not an ass and not a door mat.  and you will need couples therapy . 

  

Your story is the exact start of my 5 year marriage..  at this point i wish i would have gotten a divorce long ago.    when you're a push over, and your spouse is selfish , it CAN lead to all sorts of problems.  child neglect , cheating, spending a lot of money.. etc  (yep i ran into all of those) 

  

i really want to tell you to run like hell (metaphorically speaking, you should in actuality co-parent your kid 1/2 the time and live in the same city as your baby mama)  , but you should try and work things out with your wife for at least 6 months,  as you do have a child together. _____ - and thanks for sharing.    not in your case its better to not share with your mom since its going to damage what little trust you may have left in her.    guidance counselor at school maybe,  close long time friend, your dad ? 

  

\bad idea\ record yourself asking her not to share your private conversations with her, specifically mention its hurtful.     next time she shares one, post it to her face book.     she will stop, really fast.       chances are she won't have the introspection required for this to be an ""ah ha"" moment..    and instead she'll just be mad  that she looks like a bad parent publicly._____ - please don't talk to the help,  next thing you know they might feel like your equal. 

   in all seriousness ,  you are too kind hearted to have proper social etiquette in that circumstance.   they pay her to clean so they don't have to.  she's not hanging out with friends or family she's doing a job.  yes its very weird (probably not if you're used to it) but that's just how it is.  

  

kind of like if i take my car in for some work, they really don't want me to take off the tires.  even if i routinely do that at home and i feel weird standing there doing nothing._____ -  she should not be at work with pneumonia .   

all forms of  pneumonia are contagious.        even fungal based can be spread.  

  

its not as if her body spontaneously created the pneumonia.  

  

Yes there's a window where all of the bacteria (fungi, virus) is dead and the body still has its immune system working ,  extra mucus , coughing, etc.      But you really don't want to accidentally get someone sick  who has a compromised immune system, or a small child._____ -    Don't sign the birth certificate,  and technically this was rape,  because you didn't consent to unprotected sex.       you could go as far to file a police report,  which would help you a ton if she takes you to family court.    there's no way a DA is actually going to prosecute her,  so its sort of a win - win if you do file, as you'll have a police report.  

  

while its best to ignore them,  you could respond to her family and friends that call you a dead beat dad that she's a rapist.   (calling each other names is bound to fix things /Sarcasm)_____ -     yes if a good close friend of mine got injured I'd want to help and make sure they are okay, I'd go and visit.  

  

you said she has family there ,  2 weeks?   and now you need extra time?   

  

Clearly you are more in love with your Ex than your Current.  you GF  is picking up on this ,and is of course hurt.

But you're not necessarily an asshole simply for feeling upset or worried. The question of asshole vs not asshole depsnds on how you let your feelings it influence your actions.

 Every time before, we’ve talked about this and she’s empathized with me and agreed to commit to a process of consulting with the artist before hand, receiving a complete image, sleeping on it, and then deciding together whether to proceed.

Has she done that this time? Maybe this would turn out better if, instead of getting upset over it, you would try to participate, help her research the artist, etc._____.

She's assuming that because you're female and she's female, (I'm using that word intentionally, since it emphasizes the biological aspect), your period must be like hers.

Well, it isn't.

 Everyone in my family is telling me I was an asshole to her and that she can’t help how her body works.

You can't help how your body works.


By the way, you might have a medical condition, and should get it looked into. Some degree of pain is normal, but pain to such a degree that you are unable to even get out of bed is beyond the norm.

Other people mentioned birth control, but don't just take that as an easy fix without consulting a doctor and trying to find out what the underlying bodily issue is. A doctor-preferably a specialist-can help you decide what the best solution for you is. Because the best treatment can depend on the individual, and, while we redditors can tell you what helped us, we can't say for sure that it's what you need._____.

You sound like a 12 year old. To begin with, she's doing all the work for the party, (staying up til 2-maybe she could have gone to bed at a decent hour if you had helped), while you're just talking about how lame the party will be.

Then, when you realize she had to go in to work, the thought doesn't occur to you even then that you could tidy up a bit?

When you finally do offer, after she calls, you did a horrible job of prioritizing. You cleaned up accumulated mail (not important) but left pee stains, and let dog hair remain where people would sit. 

Now how does not knowing how to prioritize make you an asshole? Well, it's a pretty clear sign of inexperience in cleaning, i.e., a pretty clear sign that you don't clean normally, i.e., you leave it all up to your wife, (who is not a stay at home spouse)._____.

(1) When you initially tutored her, it wasn't to ""get in her pants."" You tutored her for the same reasons you did everyone else, to be nice and help her. You even kept your mouth shut about your feelings for her until after you were no longer teaching her.

(2) After her rejection of you, spending time together would have been very uncomfortable and painful, and frankly, while, she had no obligation to say yes, her ""don't talk to me because it will hurt my popularity"" was very cruel. You're not under any obligation to tutor anyone, but even if you were, she would have lost the right to it by that level of cruelty, imo._____. 

When you're married or in a long term relationship, there are certain things that are understood to be okay-by which I mean you already know that your spouse is okay with it. (Obviously you don't get a pass to do things that your spouse might not be okay with, but that wasn't the case here). Consent doesn't need to be explicitly renewed before each and every single instance of something like that.

Doing it in front of other people was a bit of a gray area, though. Since your wife seemed cool with it, I'm thinking more of the fact that the other people might not want to see it. And it is true that you should take into account the possibility that parents might not be okay with their kids seeing it. Still, I don't think it brings you into asshole territory.

Just wanted to add, having lived in California, I don't think that has anything to do with your family-in-law's extreme views about it being harassment. (Presumably your wife is from the same state as her family?) _____Edit Jump to the bottom for a revised opinion. (But I'm leaving my original opinion in here too).

Yes you're an asshole. Why would you withhold the ticket from your own sister, on the consideration that ""maybe there won't be enough tickets"" but then offer it to some girl from school?

If you were excluding your SIL so that your sister could come, that would be okay. But excluding her and your actual sister so that some girl from school could come? Asshole.
 I said yes and promised in good faith to give her one of mine...o I said, ok, I will try to get one for her...I had already assured the girl from my school that I would give her a ticket, and going back on my word makes me feel literally physically ill.

Wait...so you promised a ticket to that girl and to your SIL. How come you think uninviting that girl counts as ""going back on your word"" but uninviting your SIL doesn't?
 My mother also says that if you invite a married person to an invent, it's expected that their spouse is also invited. Is this true? 

It is true especially if the married person whom you're inviting is having to travel internationally, and their spouse with them. 

It is also the case that it's not your fault tickets are so limited, and that not having enough tickets is reason to leave a spouse out (if you clearly explain that you're unable to get more tickets). But...with tickets so limited, the girl from school should have been the person you left out.

Edit: slightly changed opinion: just re-read and picked up some more details: your mother is the asshole for inviting a friend, and then lecturing you about how ""family is more important."" And you're a pushover for letting her invite that friend.  Also, your brother is partly at fault for waiting for so long to make up his mind about whether to come-with limited tickets, he shouldn't be surprised that waiting so long resulted in the tickets being already given away.

revised opinion probably not the asshole, since your mother invited the friend, and your brother waited for so long to confirm that it's really his fault you couldn't offer his wife one in time. But maybe you didn't make it clear enough to your family early on what the situation was with the tickets.

1)you're not the asshole for wanting to end life in your own way. while i get why they are upset(many would be)about you making the choice you are they need to understand(even if it's hard and not what they want)that it's your potential death, not theirs. you are the one who would have to suffer all the affects of chemo and what it can do to you and if you don't want to experience that that is your choice. asking you to suffer, both physically and mentally, so that they don't feel emotions right now it not fair to you. you want to die with dignity and as much happiness as you can make. you should do that, even if it bothers them. BUT...

2)she's not wrong to tell your daughter the truth, even if you don't like it. she DOES deserve to know her daddy will die. blindesiding her with your sudden death would not spare her any extra pain. it would hurt like hell either way. knowing now can give her brain time to prepare for the worst. it would also create a huge rift between your wife and your daughter that would last for the rest of their lives. imagine how you would feel in that situation?? that your mom knew about it and didn't tell you?? maybe you would be fine but most people would not be. it would break your trust in that person for a life time. you would never forgive them. having your remaining family be destroyed after your death wouldn't have spared anyone any pain. it would have just created it.

if it's any consolation, i plan on choosing the same as you should i ever get cancer. i would rather live my time as happily, memory filled and as comfortable as i can than torture myself with chemo. maybe you guys should try some family counselling to help your family cope and then go make your memories with them!!_____!! holy shit, OP, back off and give him back his computer. fucking with his school work is not ok, firstly and secondly, forcing people to touch you(i don't give 2 flying fucks that it's a hug and he's your kid)is just gross, creepy and invasive. i guess you never got the memo but people DO NOT have to touch other people, IN ANY WAY, if they don't to.....yes, even minor children. they have a right to bodily autonomy just like grown ups do and they deserve some bloody god damned respect for it. 

 Edit: he has ADHD, and I saw somewhere that hugging is a good way to help him.

take the kid to a specialist for help, not so god damned mommy blog on dr. facebook. they're cesspools of friggin abuse. 

your child can show your family love in a million ways that do not require forced touching. you're teaching your kid that the phrase, ""no"", means nothing and that he has no say over his body and how it's used. do you REALLY want to give him that message? do you REALLY think that won't cause problems later down the line?? STOP!!!_____!! look, i get it. i think it's foolish and wish society was far less bubble wrapped than it is(i'm from the ""huck 6 inch spikes at each other"" generation)cause i think it's stunting children's growth but when you are in someone else's space(in this case the aquarium)you follow their rules on what they consider safe or not. they don't give 2 flying figs that you're a fireman/paramedic who is use to this shit, everyone else is not you and it's best to err on the side of the incompetent so that some fool doesn't try to litigate. 

also, your wife is right. your child does need to respect authority and flouting rules just cause you don't like them sets him up for having a rougher time in life. police are not the only authority in the world you need to respect and obey. your kid is going to be under others for most of his life. he will be required to respect them(or at least act like he does so it doesn't fuck up his life)and listen to what they say. teachers, doctors, bosses, etc are all authorities to your kid. he needs to know when to show respect and when to follow rules. _____if this is at all real....of fucking course !! seriously, what the hell is wrong with you as a person?? you need help, like professional help, if you seriously do not see how you acted made you an asshole. you're a god damn adult, do you think you can act like it even just a little bit. you're bullying and abusing a minor child. healthy minded adults do not do that.

YOU ARE NOT YOUR SISTERS KEEPER!! you don't own her and her vagina so stop acting like you do. this is the kind of thing that ruins sibling relationships. you acted like an authority in her life when you very much are not. at that tiny of an age difference, you are her equal, nothing more. you should hope for your sake that you're so straight edged they could use you for a ruler cause after acting like you did you are now in her sights and she will possibly take advantage of that to make your life miserable. you ok with her acting towards you how you acted towards her??_____!! thank you for helping this young girl who had no control over her situation/life circumstances. she didn't ask for any of this and, while i get why everyone is upset, i can not abide the coldness they are showing her. while your brothers pain is valid, i do not think it fully compares to a 7 yr old losing almost everyone she called family in one go, and it sure as hell doesn't compare to losing her mommy on top of that. she needs love, care and stability, not a system that could leave her worse off. she does not deserve to be fucked over for her moms shittiness."	fairness:1,loyalty:1,authority:1,care:7_____care:4,loyalty:1,fairness:2,authority:1_____care:6,sanctity:2_____care:3,authority:2,sanctity:2,fairness:1_____fairness:3,care:3,authority:2_____care:5,loyalty:1,authority:1	1_____1_____0_____1_____0

if she fell and possibly miscarried, would you have felt any better? i’m betting no bc while you hate the woman you are not a monster. i understand, she’s a vile creature. but in this scenario, you didn’t act much better, where you were willing to put the life of an innocent child in danger so you wouldn’t have to touch her. if she fell, would you have let her lay there or walk over her bc you couldn’t stand to be near her or touch her? i’m not saying if she fell it’d be your fault, you didn’t push her, but most people wouldn’t consider you an innocent bystander. 

for life, everybody sucks._____. You made a choice, and while it’s not bad(like missing the birth of a child for a slurpee), it still has consequences. The consequences are that right now your wife and her family don’t see you as a dependable father since you missed Day 1 when she said she NEEDED you and it was an early delivery. I’m assuming she’s pissed(rightfully so) and i wouldn’t recommend showing her this post to say “see i made the right decision” that’d probably be the nail in the coffin. Hopefully she can get past this, but i personally wouldn’t.

Also, from your wife’s POV, you could have made up with your dad at an earlier time, put in that effort instead of waiting until the literal last minute. And you said you weren’t close to your dad, so to her it sounds like you chose to be with someone you don’t like and may not make up with instead of support her. 

Tbh i don’t think you thought this out well. Would you still think it was the right decision if you and your dad didn’t resolve the issues? If he didn’t die? If your wife had serious complications in labor? If either your wife or child died? If any of those very possible scenarios you think you made the wrong decision, then you made the wrong decision a the time bc you had no idea what could happen and they each could have occurred._____Yta. Hope you’re writing the check for child support now. You don’t know for sure that this baby is yours and you destroyed this family. Are you willing to step up and be a father or did you just want to open your big mouth? _____basic politeness is helping a pregnant woman down the stairs so she doesn’t fall and hurt herself or harm her baby_____I dont think it was appropriate for you to tell other people your parents private news. Especially considering your mother’s age and the increased risk of a miscarriage, that was a gross overstep and makes . 

You don’t need to agree with what they’re doing, you protected yourself as your should. But that was way too far.

Imagine if they do lose the baby. They now have to tell people that they know didn’t want them to have it in the first place. That really pushes the knife in even further.

It's great that he's secure, but he has to find something new to talk about.
 I also told him that at least while we were struggling, my family still all loved each other and would stick together, (his parents have a rough relationship, and this has rubbed off on their relationship with him, while mine has always been very close and loving), which definitely could have made me the asshole.

You suck for this.  He didn't ask for his parents to have a rough relationship.  Money doesn't make for a good family. 
 My job hasn’t closed, but my boss has limited me to a single four hour shift a week, so that he only had to pay me $140 a fortnight, instead of $1500, which I thought was stingy and rude, but I got over it.

 I saw crap that effin sucked. Subscribed to titty models in Twitter, snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, tumblr. lots of them. All over his phone.

Leave him, he deserves better than you_____That'd be a similar case, and I still think OP's roommate would be TA for lying about their behaviour. However, OP's response would be more understandable because the things being stolen are:

1) Not essential for the roommate's survival

2) Of greater monetary value than food

All this being said, you need to stop making light of serious mental disorders. If you bothered to google the actual symptoms of kleptomania, you'd see that people diagnosed with kleptomania don't steal things they need, or for personal gain. In addition, stolen items are usually never used and are often returned when the shame kicks in.

 thank you for your input!

I picked OCD off the top of my head, and had no intention of inferring that people with OCD have no control over their actions. Rather, I wanted to point out the ridiculousness of asking someone to just stop doing something that is caused by a mental illness.

I apologize if I misrepresented OCD (as I don't actually know much about it)._____

Your intent is good, but you're enabling his behaviour and helping along his nicotine addiction. Things like juul pods for 16 year olds become illegal for a reason._____You’re not supposed to prepare to binge, because you’re not supposed to binge in the first place. It just so happens that OP has food and the roommate can’t help it.

Also I hope you realize that even if the roommate bought extra food (even though they’re not supposed to), OP’s food would probably still get eaten.

The cycles of binging and purging are extremely harmful and isn’t supposed to happen or be allowed to happen.

No one is saying that OP should let the roommate off scot free, we’re saying that OP’s attitude about the roommate’s mental illness is dismissive and insensitive._____

This is a simple lack of communication between the two of you. You consider it important that others ask you before helping themselves to your food. Your roommate likely doesn't share that view, so they don't see it as a problem.

In terms of the actual food, that's a non-issue at this point since it's been replaced. I would, however, advise that you have a discussion with your roommate about food so this doesn't happen in the future._____

You're clearly not helping your brother by doing this, but it's not your intention to hurt him either.

Maybe in future, make your posts about the stuff you get visible to everyone except your brother?

Since its a setting you expect to hear a lot of conversations i don't see what the problem is.  Unless you feel that the people he's talking to have the expectation of privacy, and still Only if your intention was to warn them. 

  

maybe his bluetooth pairing isn't work? maybe he has ear issues or other reason not to use a head set ,  maybe he told his family ahead of time ""hey you're all on speaker in a public room""  

  

I don't get the sense you didn't acted out of trying to safe guard everyone's privacy, but you acted cause you found listening to the conversation annoying. _____  -   the asshole for what having an honest expression on your face?   no way.    You should communicate with your BF about how little free time you get.  and shared time together.  

  

you guys just need to find some shared Shows,pod casts, video games that you both will enjoy.  

(overCooked is a great fun sofa game, btw)  

  

also having a bit of a game plan for joint days off could help.   if you guys have a laptop he could probably game on that (even with an xbox) while you watch some tv ,  then maybe you can watch a show on the laptop while he switches to the TV,  then after 2 hours of that you can both turn off your ""single user media"" and do something together.  

  

:)_____ - I think your brother is looking out for you sir. 

  

   Although our relationship is a bit nonconventional   
   
  asked me how many guys she has slept with (before and after we got together) 

Before , who cares. 

After , that number should be Zero.    (unless you two broke up for a while and got back together)

you might be in an abusive relationship (polyamorous / open / gas lighting)  and your brother is trying to protect you.     maybe he doesn't have the tact and verbal communication skills to do so in a gentle way, but this sounds to me like he's trying to protect you (feelings, time, etc) 

  

You'd have to explain how your relationship is unconventional, i could be wrong in my judgement.  \shrugs\

 since we live in a tiny house, a full time indoor cat for the remainder of his life just didn't seem feasible.

Given that your cat suffered multiple injuries even before this, all due to being allowed to roam outside:
 a stitched up stomach due to it being cut open after him being stuck under a fence and an almost lost ear from his glory days along with other small tweaks

given that, letting him go outside was what wasn't feasible. You should have rehomed your own cat to someone who could take proper care of him, not stolen your neighbors._____First of all, I agree that cat owners shouldn't let their cats wander onto other people's property.
But this is an  situation.
  They are feeding a cat they originally thought was a stray as well as another one. 

But now they know he isn't one. I get that they're trying to feed another cat, but if that cat belongs to yet another family, they shouldn't feed him either. You don't feed animals without their owner's permission.

 Unless you keep your cat indoors or on your own property, you have no right to get angry at them.

This is why we have the  tag, because the OP being at fault and the other person being at fault aren't mutually exclusive. _____.

It's not okay to feed other people's animals without the owner's permission. It's far worse after the owner has explicitly told you not to.

And you're the opposite of an asshole for telling them to stop. You're protecting your cat's health. 

6 lbs in a few months is a huge amount for a cat. I've seen cat obesity when I was volunteering at a shelter, and it is a serious health concern for them, (weight reduction can be very dangerous for them if done incorrectly and should be done under the guidance of a vet). You do not want this happening to your cat._____I have a dog that I love deeply, and I don't think it's inherently any different from a moral perspective to eat a cat or dog than to eat another species.

There are stories of genuine animal abuse of dogs in cultures that eat them, and that's wrong, but would be wrong with any species. I think there is more potential to end up eating someone's lost or stolen pet, which would be horrific but that's not the case with OP eating pork.                                                                            

I also used to have pet rats, but I've never judged anyone for trying to kill wild rats._____: 

(1) You guys should be consulting a vet about how much to feed them, (she's probably right about the cat being fat,and the gravity feeder was probably part of the reason it got that way, but helping cats lose weight is a tricky process because underfeeding too drastically can be dangerous for them)

(2) and you should be open about your disagreement with her, not feeding them behind her back and then trying to rehome them behind her back._____

(1) Your friend is 16, so still living with her parents in their house. If they don't want the cats on furniture, etc, they can lay down that rule, but since it's allowed, presumably they're fine with it.

(2) Yes, cat saliva is unsanitary. So is raw meat, but dishes that held raw meat and other risky things get washed (I assume her family isn't vegan) and you don't seem worried about that. As long as good dishwashing techniques are used, it's not something to worry about.

(3) Cats do need baths, and not everyone realizes that, but they're not in your house and they're not suffering from it, so it's not really your concern.

(4) Kissing cats is slightly unsanitary, but if she's a healthy person it's not that much of a risk and is none of your business."	care:2,authority:1,sanctity:1,fairness:1_____care:2,loyalty:2,authority:1_____care:3,authority:2_____care:2,sanctity:2,fairness:1_____care:4_____care:2,sanctity:1,loyalty:1	1_____1_____1_____1_____0

no adult woman, or man if you're gay, is going to be ok mothering a man-child. you might be paying rent but you're taking advantage of your parents kindness, imo, and that's not cool._____!! how the hell you think you aren't is mind boggling. the only people in this situation who aren't the assholes is your sister and brother. 

 and my sister is now bailing on me

you bailed on you sister, not the other way around, imo. you gave her 2 days, repeat 2 FUCKING DAYS, to find a solution because you lack a backbone. that is not feasible for most people. not everyone has an on call babysitter, especially one who can/is willing to look after a volatile child.

 I can't believe you're missing my wedding because your kid is antisocial""

she has to miss the wedding because her son has a bad MEL ILLNESS, that she is working on helping him cope with, and at this time can not be left with others. learn some fucking compassion here. 

 I say ""are you fucking kidding me? It's not my call to get rid of the kids so IDK why your making me feel like shit for it.

it absolutely your call. you and your FH just have no fucking backbone. it's your wedding, not your in-laws but you guys are CHOOSING to let them run the show instead of putting your foot down and telling them to piss up a rope. they've known for ages that kids would be there and they just now complaining about it?? naw, fuck that. they can come and party how they were fine with for months or they sit their asses home. 

 I'm annoyed because this isn't my choice,

YES IT IS!!! pull your head out your ass and take some bloody responsibility here. everything that is happening with your sister is YOUR  fault because you refuse to put on your, ""this is my wedding"" hat and tell your in-laws no. you don't sound mature enough to be married if you can own your own choices and decisions. grow up._____!! you went way too fucking far, OP. while  can sort of see telling him to get out so you both can avoid trouble, everything else was overboard. you DO NOT get to decide who you sister dates, you DO NOT get to deciide who she spends time with, you DO NOT get to tell her who she can fuck(illegal or not. a lot of places have romeo and juliet laws so neither of them would get in trouble legally), you DO NOT get to keep someones clothing cause stealing is wrong(and unless you're in flo/cali, you do not leave smeone outside in the middle of the fucking winter mostly naked. frostbite and hypothermia can happen quick and can be deadly), you DO NOT get to decide who comes in your house during the day(that is up to your parents) and you DO NOT  act like a giant asshole by threatening violence(he could go to the cops for that already, do not add assault/battery to your life). YOU ARE NOT YOUR SISTERS KEEPER!! you don't own her and her vagina so stop acting like you do. this is the kind of thing that ruins sibling relationships. you acted like an authority in her life when you very much are not. at that tiny of an age difference, you are her equal, nothing more. you should hope for your sake that you're so straight edged they could use you for a ruler cause after acting like you did you are now in her sights and she will possibly take advantage of that to make your life miserable. you ok with her acting towards you how you acted towards her??_____!! thank you for helping this young girl who had no control over her situation/life circumstances. she didn't ask for any of this and, while i get why everyone is upset, i can not abide the coldness they are showing her. while your brothers pain is valid, i do not think it fully compares to a 7 yr old losing almost everyone she called family in one go, and it sure as hell doesn't compare to losing her mommy on top of that. she needs love, care and stability, not a system that could leave her worse off. she does not deserve to be fucked over for her moms shittiness."	fairness:1,loyalty:1,authority:1,care:7_____care:4,loyalty:1,fairness:2,authority:1_____care:6,sanctity:2_____care:3,authority:2,sanctity:2,fairness:1_____fairness:3,care:3,authority:2_____care:5,loyalty:1,authority:1	1_____1_____1_____1_____0

if she fell and possibly miscarried, would you have felt any better? i’m betting no bc while you hate the woman you are not a monster. i understand, she’s a vile creature. but in this scenario, you didn’t act much better, where you were willing to put the life of an innocent child in danger so you wouldn’t have to touch her. if she fell, would you have let her lay there or walk over her bc you couldn’t stand to be near her or touch her? i’m not saying if she fell it’d be your fault, you didn’t push her, but most people wouldn’t consider you an innocent bystander. 

for life, everybody sucks._____. You made a choice, and while it’s not bad(like missing the birth of a child for a slurpee), it still has consequences. The consequences are that right now your wife and her family don’t see you as a dependable father since you missed Day 1 when she said she NEEDED you and it was an early delivery. I’m assuming she’s pissed(rightfully so) and i wouldn’t recommend showing her this post to say “see i made the right decision” that’d probably be the nail in the coffin. Hopefully she can get past this, but i personally wouldn’t.

Also, from your wife’s POV, you could have made up with your dad at an earlier time, put in that effort instead of waiting until the literal last minute. And you said you weren’t close to your dad, so to her it sounds like you chose to be with someone you don’t like and may not make up with instead of support her. 

Tbh i don’t think you thought this out well. Would you still think it was the right decision if you and your dad didn’t resolve the issues? If he didn’t die? If your wife had serious complications in labor? If either your wife or child died? If any of those very possible scenarios you think you made the wrong decision, then you made the wrong decision a the time bc you had no idea what could happen and they each could have occurred._____Yta. Hope you’re writing the check for child support now. You don’t know for sure that this baby is yours and you destroyed this family. Are you willing to step up and be a father or did you just want to open your big mouth? _____basic politeness is helping a pregnant woman down the stairs so she doesn’t fall and hurt herself or harm her baby_____I dont think it was appropriate for you to tell other people your parents private news. Especially considering your mother’s age and the increased risk of a miscarriage, that was a gross overstep and makes . 

You don’t need to agree with what they’re doing, you protected yourself as your should. But that was way too far.

Imagine if they do lose the baby. They now have to tell people that they know didn’t want them to have it in the first place. That really pushes the knife in even further.

They won't have to deal with a father who verbally abuses you and sics his family members to harass you.  You did this out of love for yourself and a theoretical person who's going to have to navigate the world.

Marriage is not about changing dynamics entirely when it suits one of you but not the other.  You haven't even had a calm conversation with your wife about how you're feeling overwhelmed and would really appreciate if she could help you with some discipline for things like homework versus video games.  She doesn't need to be his new mom but this was an unprecedented situation and you need help in navigating it.  You approved of the cool aunt dynamic and married her knowing that she did not want to be a motherly figure.  She's not wrong if she decides this is more than she can handle.

If a parent moves in requiring round-the-clock care, they may be eligible for state support or a professional caretaker.  The equivalent of that caretaker for your hypothetical is hiring a nanny.  Parenting and caring for someone ill enough to need 24/7 care are two completely different situations.

Your son needs professional support to help him cope, not a new mom.  It's not like he can hang out with his friends offline.  He doesn't get access to the usual distractions of a normal world.  He isn't going to respond well to his stepmom diving right into replacement-mom mode_____, but it shouldn't be a secret.  Your wife is being unreasonably petty.  At the time, he was 17.  He was a minor and she was 20.  What 17 year old is prepared to be a parent when they're still a kid?  Will you tell her about lending him money?  What if you pay bills directly on his behalf so you know the money is going to something that supports the child?  The better off he is, the better off your sweet little girl will be.  His repayment can go into a college fund for her if that'll make you two more comfortable.

Has he applied for pandemic unemployment compensation?  If not, he needs to do so.

It's great that you want to take care of part of your parenting team._____""A little extreme""? ""A bit better""? OP doesn't know anything about her own husband because he's so secretive. He doesn't even bother to communicate to his life partner that his mother, her mother-in-law is sick. She is too afraid of oversharing to be able to contact him in an emergency. Child birth can be life-threatening. He has the audacity to blame OP for why he wasn't there when all he had to do was check his phone. As a husband, he should give a shit about being reachable in an emergency let alone for a planned birth. This moron thinks a woman in labor should've  physically tracked him down at an office she can't even call because he's isolated parts of his life so deeply. 

If this man is so self-absorbed, secretive, and ignorant to bother checking his phone to read a text from his about-to-pop wife, there are divorce-worthy issues here. Don't get married and have a child if you're unwilling to have personal conversations with your own spouse. Topical conversation only lasts for so long and OP will have a lonely life if they stay._____Not an asshole situation.  You're obviously not an asshole for keeping your daughter safe from an abuser.  You ought to seek out a family law attorney to see about your husband getting custody.  Your ex abandoned you and your child.  He hasn't been in her life this entire time.

This is truly lawyer territory.  Do not allow him to see your child._____.  Get your child into therapy if you can.  Skipping school is unacceptable and she very well may need help with her self esteem.  You may not be able to stop her from having sex, but you can make sure she's protected from pregnancy.

This is NOT joking, it is bullying and verbal abuse on you for something you were likely bullied about for years. Something you can not help. Tell him you don’t want to go because everyone makes fun of your stutter. If he convinces you to go, tell him that if ANYONE says something about it, you’re not going back for 6 months. If it happens again after that, it’s a year._____Yta? They really need to invent a new abbreviation for both options. It is going to be really hard for him to transition, it is going to be very upsetting to lose his girl network, but it is also understandable that you want to respect his new gender identity, and only Have a girls night with the girls. It is really a sticky situation, but, I doubt that he is going to all of a sudden turn into a rapist unless he was one before. His gender does not change his criminal background and personality that significantly.  for assuming that now, since he is transitioning to a guy, he made rape you guys or take advantage of you guys in some way shape or form, but I think the other things are not necessarily transphobic. Maybe there are some other sub Reddit’s that may be able to help you navigate the situation better. There has to be a support group out there that can help everyone through this.

Of course the mom charges the kids for small things like gas   insurance, that's generally called parenting. Their tuition, clothes, food, phones, and activities are likely still funded by her and possibly her husband. He absolutely should be required to pay for health insurance since he's non custodial and paying far less than half of their actual expenses and is likely court ordered to do so. She's been paying more than her fair share and the OP's resentment might make you feel bad for him, but go back and reread what he said between insults. He's only paying 875 a month between two kids. That 437 apiece isn't covering half of either child's expenses.  For 3 years she   her husband were covering insurance, before that the OP got insurance for free. So this is the first time he's paid for their insurance and had to pay support. He's been getting over and now he isn't._____No, there really isn't a ""better"" way to legislate a dissolution of community property than a 50/50 split. Divorces were less common and marriages lasted longer because women (generally lower earners because of things like gender and caregiving) couldn't afford to leave. Higher earners don't have a right to benefit from the labor of their lower earning partners who generally enable them to make more by taking on more of the household labor thus freeing higher earners up to work more and earn more. 

If my husband and I were to split right now he would get half, I actually earn more, but his schedule is more flexible. So, he takes on the lion's share of childcare for our 15 year old which is school meetings, doctor appointments, and driving lessons currently, but is also likely to include tutoring and transportation come fall. I've been the partner that did those things and if we'd gotten divorced when the kids were little I would have been entitled to half then too. Marriage is a partnership socially and legally and across time there's going to be 60/40 years or even 90/10 years in either direction, but it tends to average out to 50/50_____ This sounds like you need to stop telling him financial information that you want private like your salary. When he complains (which he will) explain again that you do not want your financial information shared with his family. Since he refuses to respect that you're taking steps to protect your privacy. I would tell him before hand too, but honestly it doesn't sound like he'll listen until he has no choice._____I'm not cherry picking. I'm pointing out that they made an agreement   they could have had a conversation. I'm currently the primary breadwinner in my family, I still talk to my husband about money that comes in outside of our standard income. It's a partnership, in good ones you make a point of communicating. When it comes to marriage and money, it's much better to over communicate than under communicate. Right now I'm paying down both of our old loan debt because I'm the breadwinner. When he was the breadwinner he paid them down. OP's got a lifetime with his wife, might be good to get used to not seeing debt (which a mortgage will be too) as only belonging to one person if paying it benefits the family_____ Yet. The best thing to do instead of loans is to talk to the hospital about their charity program (every hospital has one even if they don't have signs up and a hospital social worker can help), contact cancer charities, and set up a GoFundme. That's the part your can help with   with that combination even though you might need to collectively plan on family chipping in to cover what the GFM does not (if anything) he should be able to get what he needs without you taking on a massive amount of debt._____Lower paying than 6 figures doesn't equal a shitty job.

first, there should be clear expectations and metrics for each of their group assignments(give them a rubric?) so that if it’s incoherent, they are all failing, losing points. otherwise you’re not actually improving their skills if they’re not clear on what needs to be improved. this is also helpful when dealing with students debating their grades. if you did not have a clear rubric that outlines what they need to meet and where they failed, you will to continue to have this problem. 

second, group assignments have individual portions. so either you’re grading them individually for each of their work within the group or you’re grading the whole group(everyone gets the same grade) for the group presentation(as in grading to the rubric, they score points and that is the same score for each student in the group). you don’t get to have it both ways, scoring them individually and giving the grade to the group. it sounds like you want the second, and that’s fine. but do your job right. you can add to the rubric a portion (10 pts whatever) that grades each members participation. but the overall message, communication should be graded.
that’s how you fix the flow issues.

third, if you saw this problem repeatedly the solution is to start assigning group and have more individual presentations. make a rule that you can only work with every student once. 

fourth, A is right. it’s not their job to motivate a student. you can talk with d individually, his parents. and then you grade him accordingly. if he does not want to put in the effort it’s not his friends job to drag him over the finish line. 

fifth, and i can’t believe this needs to be said,
YOU DO NOT FAIL TO PROVE A POINT. that is really not how teaching works. 

i’m sorry, but there is nothing more frustrating and disappointing than a bad teacher blaming their shortcomings on the students. each child is different, if everyone single one of them from an A student to a failing one is telling you you’re doing your job wrong, you need to re-evaluate your own work. there’s a reason why student evaluations are important._____You’re right there’s assholes in hs.

Yeah, if you’re advocating cheating on those group texts he’s right to tell your teacher, esp if you’re a “teachers pet/nerd”. Do you really not get that cheating is wrong. You’re trying to cover up your mistake and deceit(IMO trying to keep the innocents teachers pet facade is deceit) by humiliating him publicly. And that actually might back fire on you and actually push him to showing your teacher.

You are just taking care of your own mental health. She is annoying for you, for your group, and apparently doesn't let you have a good time out because she always needs to be wasted. It's completely normal if you don't want to keep giving her more chances.

I'm not tagging as she is TA since I believe her behaviour might be justified if the reasons she told you are real._____.

  I feel like masturbating is 10 times better than what I am having with you right now 

That must have hurt, and you knew it before you said it.

If your GF doesn't want to try any new things and it doesn't fulfil your sexual life, you might have to move on, but she is not TA for not wanting to do some sexual practices. However, she sounds extremely selfish (in the bed, I mean), and according to what you said she doesn't seem to be willing to help at all with the problem you guys have.

  

PS: masturbating a lot can damage the nerves on the penis, but the damage is not permanent. If you stop masturbating you will most likely regain sensibility and feel a lot more when having sex with her. But maybe it's too hard for you to try, who knows._____.

You must take care of your needs first. 

Your girlfriend isn't getting it, and she should. However, that doesn't make her TA; he just shares how she's feeling with you.

You might want to find a mutually satisfying compromise. I mean talking with her and dial it to a point you are both OK with. However, if she is demanding more of you than you are willing to give, also be honest about it. Your needs have to come first so you don't resent your relationship on the long run._____.

The question at the end of the post is way different than the question on the title. I answered the one int he title.

If the conversation leads to you breaking up it's not the same that if you break up with her because of this.

You say you love her, been 2 years together, love taking care of her and spending time and talking to her every day. Yet you would rather have sex with other people and are willing to break up over this. Then you more likely don't actually love her.

Being attracted to others is very normal, and the feeling of ""I was so much better when I was single"" is too. But considering breaking up with someone you claim to be great with, and someone you claim to love.. Meh, asshole, sorry.

PS: On a whole other topic: consider talking about open relationships. They can work very well and if you are being sincere about your feelings it might be what you want. Just remember it's a 2-way street._____What would telling her superior about her intentions accomplish to you?

She won't get fired because of it. You will antagonize someone which relationship with you isn't just professional... 

Also, if you were your future boss, would you trust someone who is willing to do this just to advance a bit faster?

PS: 9 months IS a really small amount of time, unless you are in a position where you can't sustain yourself until the time comes_____.

It's only natural that she wants to spend time with you. But you also need some time to yourself. It doesn't mean that you should never spend your time together, after all you are a couple and both of you should take care of the relationship, only that you also get to decide how much of that time you need for yourself.

Whether or not she can control what she does (and if she really does have DID [which kind of blows my mind, that's rare and controversial to say the least] she might not be able to) you are allowed to protect yourself from people that are harming you. 

For a long, LONG time, I was really hung up on the concept of responsibility - my dad was/is an alcoholic and abused my sister and I pretty viciously. I was obsessed with whether or not I could forgive him, and whether or not his behavior was his ""fault"" or not. If alcoholism was a disease, wasn't he NOT responsible, so was I the asshole for being upset about it?

A really wise therapist completely changed that question for me. She asked me to think of my dad as a rabid dog. Is it the dog's fault that they're attacking me? no, because they have rabies. But do I still need to protect myself from that dog? Yes, I do. I can't stand still and LET the dog attack me simply because the dog doesn't know any better. So think of your sister as a rabid dog - maybe she can't help what she does, maybe she can. But either way, you have a responsibility to protect yourself and your family from the harm she does.

so now that I've said all that - when was she diagnosed with DID, and what do her doctors think caused it? from everything I've read, DID is usually associated with severe trauma, which doesn't seem to jibe with your recounting of a safe childhood._____ (or maybe , it seems to me that your step-mom is misinformed or misguided here)

You can't reason with an addict. As a person who grew up with a violent alcoholic father, please get yourself to Al-Anon meetings (support group for friends and family of alcoholics), it is really, REALLY helpful.

Why would she shame a little kid for crying? that's pretty fucked up. 

That said, it sounds like she felt she was put on the spot and that she just screwed up, to some degree. Sometimes in parenting, I've found things coming out of my mouth that were things my parents said to me (like getting annoyed with one of my kids for making a giant brouhaha over something that could only matter to a child) that I know are fucked up and dumb things to say, but because I'm worked up for whatever reason (like your wife was worked up, worrying about her son being homesick, etc) they just kind of fly out of my mouth. I have always caught myself pretty much immediately and apologized and corrected myself, but I've had fucking YEARS of therapy too. 

I would go talk to your wife, and ask her about the origin of that comment. Was that something her parents said to her? What was she feeling when she said it? Would it be so bad if the neighborhood kids did find out that a nine year old kid was homesick and upset their first time at sleepaway camp?  Try to draw her out about why she said it, what was she trying to achieve, etc."	loyalty:1,care:8,authority:2,sanctity:3_____authority:1,loyalty:2,sanctity:3,care:2_____care:4,loyalty:2_____authority:1,loyalty:2,care:2_____loyalty:1,authority:1,fairness:2_____care:3,loyalty:1	1_____1_____0_____0_____0

That's not at all what she said or what he said. 

 My wife is saying that I get one on one time with our son and this is an opportunity for her to do the same. I think it is a good idea for her to bond with our kids one on one too.

She claims she wants to go alone because she she wants time to bond with the mentioned son, despite having 4 days off a week alone. Not about the other kid who was only mentioned in passing.

Yet she's not even going with them alone. She's also going with her friend and her friend's kid/kids.
 
When dad goes, it's after work or weekends, and he also must take both kids.

She admits the friend actively discludes him on a regular basis.

 Every time this friend wants to get together with my wife, she never wants the family to be included. It's always dinner and drinks with the girls, beach trip with only the kids-no husbands allowed and now, she wants to my wife to bring our son to Legoland for the weekend and I am not permitted to go.

  I asked her if she could name a single one of my friends that makes her feel excluded and unwelcome and she can't. She recognizes that her friend always wants it to be a girls only or no husbands type of deal but justifies it as ""I don't have very many friends I want to hang out with.""

What speaks about her character is that she says it's unfair she he takes the child in question to the zoo and beach and she wants time with him too. But she has 4 days off! Dad is spending time with him after work and some weekends. He has 2 days off. What speaks about her character is that due to him being upset she's going without him, she calls him names and tries to make him feel like a villain. He says he just wants her to understand how he feels. There is zero evidence he's controlling or an asshole. All we have to go on is what he tells us. Making up plausible scenarios isn't going on the facts we have. So we can only say ""based on this, I feel this."" Logic based on given facts.

Your wife ""won't work"" and here you were working 7 am to midnight, and she's not only refusing to do laundry, dishes, and clean the bathroom, but she expects you to do it at midnight?? You were working two jobs for her lazy ass. Now you finally work one job, and you come home and make your own dinner and take care of the kids. Not together. Just you. While she stares at the t.v and you rub her legs? if she had a job, you'd both be responsible for taking care of your kids after work.
You are a doormat who has done this to yourself. She's a lazy hypoctite. But you let this happen. You have been working yourself to death rather than stand up for yourself. Guess what?  If you divorced her, she'd need to get a job. Stop letting her walk all over you._____He is working 12 hour days and coming home to take care of the kids after. She has a nanny taking care of the kids for almost the entire day and refuses to help him get sleep to rest for a potentially dangerous job. At this point she could easily still work outside the home. But this is a waste of my time . Not interested in arguing with people just because they don’t like differing opinions or who think the wife gets a pass because she gave birth. Enjoy arguing with everyone you disagree with._____.
Your wife seems very damaged, but she took her family's side after they made it clear they didn't care about her. Your FIL is behaving on a paranoid and insane way. I'd honestly cut off all future contact. Yourself and any future kids. Tell your wife now that you don't want your kids around them.
Curious why you didn't report them to the church. His behavior is toxic. _____
It’s the multiple failed businesses that changes it from . 
She said she got to make the financial decisions because she made more, and he accepted it. Now he makes more and he said it’s only fair he gets to decide. She called him an asshole and cried. While the decisions should not be only one or the other, they should be BOTH, he accepted it when she disagreed. That makes her unfair and a hypocrite. He should not have put up with her controlling financial decisions and telling him it’s because she made more, but he agreed to it. Making her the asshole for being a giant hypocrite when the tables turned. He put her through multiple failed businesses, but it sounds like she never used that as her reasoning, which is a little odd. In the end he cannot be the only asshole because he is doing exactly what she did._____
She shouldn’t have been trying on her clothes. She had no business doing that.
However. You seem more concerned with giving your kids a mother, and that’s not really fair to her. You should marry her because you love her and can’t imagine life without her. Yet you tell her she can only put her clothes in the closet if there’s room with all of your deceased wife’s clothes in there.
Grieving has no time limit and you absolutely should feel free to keep her clothes as she left them for as long as you need. But at the same time, you can’t bring in your new almost wife and tell her she can’t have closet space. 
I’d say you aren’t ready yet. Give yourself and your kids time to adjust to life without her, and move your new partner in when you are actually ready.

If it doesn't go along with the religion you are teaching your kids, or that you are practicing,  then don't attend the wedding but attend the reception.  

  

your sister will hate you for a while, but sometimes faith requires sacrifice, requires being a martyr.        Or love the sinner hate the sin.    go anyways and teach your kids that we live in a secular society where people are often free to make life choices that goes against Gods teachings.   that we must choose the more difficult task,  which is keeping society free enough that people can make choices that go against our own religion, because their religion may be different._____ -   your dad is not entirely wrong, in that it is probably common for divorced parents to bring their new partners to their child's wedding.    but its also common for plus ones  not to be someone who will be highly antagonistic to the wedding partner or guests of honor (which would be your mother)  . 

  

as long as your dad ultimately respects your wishes and shows up stag , he's also not an Ass. 

  

suggestion - you could maybe run it by your mom?  you could even make him ask your mom.   if she truly doesn't care then you're basically Scott free to allow him to have his plus 1.

as long as you are being polite and honest about your reasons its not really an asshole thing to do.    

  

basically you are stating yes i could go with my friends but it won't be quite as enjoyable compared to me going solo.  and i would rather get that extra bit of enjoyment than compromise , and  have the shared experiences with my friends. 

  

this will be a bit hurtful to your friends and BF ( could even be damaging to your relationship)  but you have decided to put your own enjoyment  first.   but it sounds like you are being open and honest about it.    I'm gonna stay with No, you're not an asshole.  :)

funerals aren't for the dead, they are for the living,  primary think of this funeral is for your GF .   even for the religious a funeral is to help the living grieve .  which is part of the healing process , dealing with such a loss, and moving forward in her life. 

  

its not like they were gonna require you to renounce Christ or anything.   you should have been there to support your GF in her greatest moment of grief, agony, loneliness  and despair. 

  

if you love her apologize for your selfishness and short nearsightedness.     

  

if she doesn't break up with you, you will never live this down.

    She says that one of them can’t be there, and that it’s not fair for MOH to both get cheated on, and then ALSO not able to go to the wedding because we “chose” FRIEND over her. 

  

that.   its up to your friend to work things out with the MOH to be able to still be the best man.(or if he can't patch things up enough , then he's out of that honor spot)   but he should be allowed in the wedding / reception as he is someone still close to you. 

  

ask your Fiance if people who make other mistakes in life should be banned?   someone with a drug addiction problem, maybe someone who drank and drove, etc, etc,

you should just ask your mom for a sincere apology that she never took you on that special trip that your sisters got, but you didn't.

Though its obvious  to me, that  your step dad has been paying for the trips, and this was probably out of your moms control.  maybe he initially said he would pay for it, and later couldn't, or wasn't willing to.

One of them probably wouldn't mind that much, she's working with super poor people and has developed a very open mindset about almost everything. 

One of them for sure would be devastated, she's a contemplative and takes all that super seriously, once she went into depression because my brother and his girlfriend were living together without being married.

The third one... I'm not sure, to be honest. But I don't think she'd take it well._____I have taken care of nephews on ocassion and did it gladly, but I can understand where OP came from because it's about having boundaries. The way I see it, the sister wasn't treating it as a favor or help, but as an obligation, and in that case I think I would also be inclined to reject it out of principle, particularly if it's a pattern of behaviour. It's not about the particular effort of helping, but about the assumption that you have no choice on the issue.

  She wasn't trying to force him to help, she didn't insult him or beg him

I think ""But nephew loves you so much"" sounds like trying to guilt trip OP to help, which is a way to try to force him. 

  But I would not hesitate to watch them for my uncle because I know he would help me with anything in a heartbeat. 

That's something we should probably ask about OP's relationship with his sister. 

What OP's sister said was ""we can work it out"". For me, it sounds like an assumption that what they would work out was HOW OP would take care of the kids. For what I can see from the conversation, I don't see an attempt to negotiate, and the offence I think doesn't come from the assumption that OP would have no problem but from the assumption that OP would have no CHOICE. I think if I was presented with a situation like that I would be offended too and would feel the need to clarify a boundary. 

Now, OP probably chose a bad moment to enforce that, but probably it was because of how blatant that was. An asshole move? Maybe. Justified? I'd personally think yes._____I'd swear I read another version of this post six months ago. 

I think . You have a reason to feel the way you feel, and even if your siblings are hurt, it's one of those things families need to solve together._____ for the fight but your dad is the bigger asshole for telling you not to do something and then berating you for not doing it. 

Are punch fights a common occurence in your family? It sounds highly dysfucntional._____Look, if you can't help your little sister because you're in debt it will be because someone pulled your college funds forcing you to get in debt. And that's not your fault. 

And that someone is telling to take care of family, but she's failing to do that exact thing. You're family too and she's not taking care of you. 

._____  originally we were going to have her brother and her cousin (like a sister) as godparents but got so much shit from my parents that my brother deserves it more since he was best man

That would be a good reason to make your wife's brother the godfather. Otherwise one gets everything and the other gets nothing. 

Also, a Christening is mostly a religious ocassion. You are already doing it to accomodate them, if they care more about the social aspect of it it's on them.

maybe you’re too young to remember the cause for “it gets better”. young teens lost after being bullied for their sexuality was a daily thing you’d see on the news. ppl like you constantly bullying and provoking and hurting. and it wasn’t to only teens that were out but to ppl like your brother who weren’t safe or ready to make that choice yet. this was just 10 years ago. and it still happens today. 

1. is being gay funny or smth to ridicule for you, why?
2 what “behavior” or things he said made you think he was gay? were you just going off stereotypes?
3. why are you picking being gay as smth to bully your brother with? 
4. why wouldn’t you support your brother if you thought that was a possibility 
5. why were you avoiding saying this in front of your parents; have they said homophobic potentially violent or hate filled comments?

you are homophobic. you’ve done a huge disservice to your brother. and instead of apologizing and offering support you’re playing the victim that you’re innocent bc you didn’t know he was actually gay.

even if he wasn’t gay you were still bullying him! this just makes it worse. this is basic empathy. and while i would explain with an analogy for you, frankly i’m too annoyed to not make it insulting. 

apologize. then do research and apologize again._____i disagree completely. ops sister is using the benefit of common decency and understanding for a very personal moment(her coming out) as a shield for her consistent sexual harassment.

What is wrong with you? Seriously, you need professional help. You believe that your bil cheated on your friend and is abusive to your sister with no proof! And then you make a heinous accusation against them that can tear their family apart. Are you lonely and need attention, because this is incredibly toxic behavior. What makes you think you know your sister is being abused or that BIL is a a cheater, your intuition? Take some probiotics bc that gut is rotten. Honestly, at least your family can cut you out and finally have peace(hopefully)._____she wants to protect them she can contact CPS. her aunt and cousin have 0 power to do anything to help their siblings. 

it was simply a move to shame and embarrass them. and it’s NOT ops news to share, whether she’s happy or not for them. it’s a gross overstep._____Respect is not commanded it’s earned. And given the fact that he threatened the brother and was arrested for conspiracy to commit murder I’m not sure the brother would welcome this conversation._____

my point is that something's off with this kid, and mum didn't react appropriately. if one of my kids had kicked a cat, lied about it, and refused to apologize, they would have been punished, probably by taking electronic devices away. it sounds like OP's mum just sort of gave up after a while and sent the kid away without further punishment._____i mean...you're only positing situations where this kid is being mistreated / feeling bad and bullying because of that.

And HR if your company has it. Depending on the structure of the company it could be very helpful or a disaster. _____. You’re allowed to make whatever rules you want, and your daughter is allowed to express herself with clothing how she likes, as she’s an adult. 

However, you should pick your battles. You are being controlling and you’ll push her away with this. She’s a college student hanging out with other college students. By policing her clothing you’re damaging your relationship._____ - the kids don’t care - this is about you policing your gf’s body and style. Bad form._____I think if you randomly meet someone and start slagging of their appearance, that’s totally rude, off side, OMG, you’re the asshole. 

However, I believe Tinder is one of those things that is all about the look (I’ve never used it, so jump in if I’m wrong). If that’s the case, being somewhat honest about the look seems polite and only using trick shots or pics that are ten years old, or photoshop for days, is just setting everyone up for disappointment. To flip it, I KNOW that I’ve seen posts where a woman posts that she was on tinder or pof or whatever, used a 10 year old, 50 lb thinner pic ‘because I’m totally going to lose the weight!’ and then winds up disappointed when the guy never wants to see her again. 

Obviously, if a guy said ‘you’re a fatty, get away from me’ he would be a dick. However, when I’ve read the aforementioned posts, dude will be more like ‘You look different than in your picture.’ or ‘I like really sporty girls.’ And even one where the guy flat out said she was much bigger than her picture and he felt deceived. I don’t think any of those guys are assholes (at least not for those comments).  

_____You know, one time I went to a child's birthday party with a full on Nicki Minaj boob type display going on because I was nursing and my formerly modest top had morphed into a...Nicki Minaj boob fest. 

When I got home and discovered this, I asked my husband why he didn't tell me and he said he didn't want to comment and assumed that I knew. 

I wish he would have told me, because a child's birthday party was no place for the display I was putting on. 

  

So, with that out of the way, . You told your GF because you assumed she would want to know. She's expressed that she doesn't so going forward you can skip mentioning things like this to her._____So, I say . 

  

You obviously aren't fat shaming, so your . She MAY be using her twin's pics, so she might be TA; however, her twin could be using her's too. I feel like twins often do funny trickster things so I'm not sure there's any way to confirm which pic is which unless you meet the twins together. 

  

So, I dunno. You certainly don't have to date anyone, and someone being a trickster is as good a reason as any to skip a second date.

She loves her son even if she has an addiction and isn't likely to hand him over to a legal stranger just because that's what the OP wants. 

The kids have known their aunt and uncle as long as the OP so there's no reason they should be expected to go with the OP and not biological relatives who would have a greater claim in court anyway. That's the legality and the morality sorted. 


I never said his past was a crime. I said that it is likely a consideration in her decision making. And she certainly doesn't owe her kids putting them with someone they aren't related to for however many years because the OP doesn't have a plan for his child. It's not about what she owes her late husband or the OP for her, it's about what she owes her kids. The money is why he wants her will altered to split finances three ways as she's the one who earns more and has more savings. He wants her to take the inherited and saved money that would pay for her kids to get educations and split it differently so that they get less and his child with someone else gets a share. He also wants her to choose a guardian that will take his child which would mean her kids going to an unrelated stranger. 

Trusting him as her romantic partner has nothing to do with trusting him to be the sole guardian of her children from a prior relationship who still have an ongoing relationship with their late father's family. Especially when the unreasonable ask in this situation is likely the moment when she realized that her trust was misplaced.

She's not worried about appearances, she's fed up with manipulative moments that are commonly projected onto new mothers about when they get to be away from the baby and spouse. She didn't ask for couple time, she didn't even ask her mother to baby sit. Her mother offered, they accepted, and when her friend offered some fun time being who she was before motherhood she chose a few hours to be untouched, silly, and an adult. Oh the horrors of her thinking her emotional health matters even if the OP and her mother think such things aren't important. There's almost no chance the OP wasn't aware of her mother's likely response, and that's why she got mad.

3)none of what you describe is automatically linked to drugs. tons of medical issues cause those symptoms. could it be drugs? sure but health issue is more likely given that most people actually don't do drugs. did you ever take her to the doctor??

 My brother's ex girlfriend had a baby and my brother refused the paternity test because he's a dumbass who thinks if he doesn't take a paternity test, she can't come after him for child support.

Sigh.

 my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for ""betraying the family"" and ""trying to fuck my brother over.""

Have you pointed out to them that your brother kind of can't refuse a paternity test if the court orders it? They're postponing the inevitable.
_____ I guess my problem is that it seems that by default, the father has no say. He has to go through legal hoops and paperwork with the exact perfect timing just to have the privilege of raising his own child.

I understand what you're saying, but having to go through the legal hoops and paper work with ""perfect timing"" is a necessary function of the fact that pregnancy doesn't continue indefinitely. That baby is coming out in 40 weeks no matter how anyone feels about it. 

 I just feel like it would suck wanting to have custody of your child only to be told that you weren't emotionally supportive enough to the mother who didn't even consider you as a potential parent before considering adoption.

I doubt that would actually disqualify a father who got a lawyer and tried to get custody of the kid. I think this is more about serious abuse, not just ""not emotionally supportive enough"", etc. 

 It also sounds like an enormous (and somewhat easy to exploit) loophole for mothers trying to avoid child support.

oh, you mean women who want to give up the kid but avoid paying child support to the kid's dad if he got custody of it? maybe. but again, a father who got a lawyer and really kept trying to get custody would probably get it, IMO. The really sticky part of this, and the place where I see the most potential for serious issues is that a lot of the time the woman can probably just say ""no I have no idea who the father is"" if she really wanted to do that, and if she had a way of keeping the news of her pregnancy from the father._____ The real kicker is if there’s a judgment against him and he turns out not to be the father he’d still have to fight to get the judgment removed. So is the bias of family court.

so it behooves him to cooperate, it would seem. Perhaps he's so adamantly refusing the test because he knows he's the father._____

Protect your child from the meth-addicted felon._____you're much safer not allowing him to have a relationship with your child if he has delusions of ""parenting"" your kid. Your father sounds like exactly the kind of asshole to sue for access to your child under ""grandparents' rights""._____

If you can't correct kids when they're misbehaving you can't keep them safe, because a lot of childhood discipline is designed around the safety of the child. You're right and they're wrong.

Many times very rich people will go ahead and have prenups in place so that if things go bad, they can divorce without a bunch of public hooplah.

I have a friend who had one that said something like 50% of equity gained during marriage, and a certain percentage of estate every ear up to x%. He will pay 100% of school, childcare, and housing for spouse and children till said children are 18, or leave the home. He will pay for college. All that. It was basically a requirement to marry him. The prenup was very reasonable for her if anything happened… although I think there were a few exclusions in it too… like, if if she was unfaithful or abusive or something she forfeited her claim to any of the estate and blah blah.

Now she's trying to rely on the false idea that there is a moral way to fight oppression to avoid dealing with the consequences of her choices. Civility is a great way to maintain the status quo. It does absolutely nothing to combat oppression. The narrative of the moral high ground assumes that it matters (which it does not) who follows arbitrary behavior rules in an unfair fight._____The sister already thinks abusing a child because of her bigotry is okay. She was going to justify her behavior regardless of his response, she just learned to leave him alone. You seem focused on changing the oppressive person's mind. We already know that rarely happens. What does work is fighting back, and you don't become the oppressor because you defended yourself. Victims of abuse don't owe their abuser more kindness or respect.

She's still in the middle of a high risk pregnancy during a pandemic. I don't think it is that she doesn't care about her sister so much as there's only so much she can control here. She can not bring up pregnancy to her sister (and she doesn't), but she can't control what other people say, nor can she (also chock full of hormones) take being the object of her sister's ire for something that is no one's fault, but especially not hers. I understand that you chose to bend over backwards   maybe the OP could try to do more bending, but currently in the middle of her pregnancy her sister has taken to making demands, yelling obscenities and will not take herself out of situations that she finds triggering. It's likely that the husband (not on the actual call but visible in the background) said what he did innocently, then the sister instead of closing the app (which is what I would have chosen) starts yelling insults and obscenities. Sure they can exclude her from future calls, but the OP's not wrong to point out that they can't give her what she apparently needs (which is space away from pregnancy and grief counseling IMO) while still leading their actual lives. The OP can't roll back the clock on her pregnancy, she's in a high risk group for the virus so I understand why everyone is checking on her because (among other things) she's at risk of losing more than a pregnancy if she goes into a hospital right now.

She was out there having these wonderful experiences and making new friends, and she continued to try and keep you a part of it by trying to share that experience with you. You say she sent you lovely, heartfelt things, is it really reasonable for you to expect her and her new friends to go into a state of mourning for your mother?

test	telling my wife that she looks good bigger	"NTA. The only thing you said that's a little iffy is the word ""thicker""

Let me tell you a story. My wife and I got together in high school. She was skinny as a rail. I dated a blonde girl who was curvy (not fat) right before I met my wife. To this day (22 years later) my wife will say that I like ""chubby blondes"", even though - 1) I only dated that girl for 2 months, 2) she was not ""chubby"", 3) I much prefer pale redheads like my wife. In fact, I've told her that there are times where I see a woman and I get a shock on the inside, like ""whoa....she's stunning!"" I eventually realized that the only time that happens is with women who look very similar to my wife. All of this is important later. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've had a bunch of kids over the years and she's definitely got the mom bod going on. **I love it.** A while back she was complaining about her weight. It was 6-9 months after she had a baby. 

""I so need to lose some weight.""

""I dunno man.... you've got curves in all the right places and I think you look pretty fucking hot.""

""SEE! I KNEW YOU LIKED THEM CHUBBY!!!""

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't even give her a **legitimate, genuine** compliment about how I really feel about her size, and that's how I **really** feel. She knows that I don't blow smoke up her ass. If she gets a haircut I don't like, I'll tell her, ""eh....it looks good, but I preferred you hair longer.""

_____!! dude, i get it hurts but come on. it's not like you're recovering from a heart attack here. it's just a fucked up ankle. you could have rented a wheelchair for the day. a ton of pharmacies do that. you could have booked it when you first hurt your ankle and if you didn't need it the day of just cancelled it. what you did was pretty damn heartless, imo. you seriously couldn't have toughed it out for an hour ceremony?? you could have gone to just that since it's nothing but fucking sitting once you get to your seat(and unless she had the wedding on a football field it wasn't that long of a walk to your seat)and skipped the reception if was hurting that bad since the ceremony is the truly important part. your daughter has every right being upset with you right now._____!! if you are responsible for people's lives and wellbeing you better damn well do your job the way it needs to be done. people shouldn't have to sit in pain or not have what they need because jackaninny refuses to do what they should. i get nursing is hard but that many mishaps is too damn many._____maybe not(but i hope so). an old friend of mine used abortion almost as if it was the same as birth control. it really turned me off of wanting associate with her. she refused birth control and refused to use condoms so she'd just get pregnant and then have an abortion(cause apparently she was cheating). i knew for about 3 years before she told me this. 8 times she did it!! so fucking gross!_____!! your personal life is not your business life. they should not mix. your employees should not suffer because you decided to divorce or got sick. that is not their problem. they did there jobs. they apparently did good enough you had a great year despite everything going on. they should get a reward for that. 

you know you're doing wrong or you wouldn't have tried to force the person below you to be the scapegoat for your employees ire. that's scummy asf. 

if you had done terribly during the plague i'd get it. if you were filling bankruptcy i'd get it but neither of those appear to be true so do what every other single person does when they have to use their personal savings on unexpected things....slowly build it back up over time._____!! rightfully those belong to his family anyway as they are his next of kin."	care:3,authority:2,sanctity:1_____care:4,sanctity:1_____care:2,sanctity:1,authority:1_____sanctity:1,authority:2,fairness:1_____sanctity:3,care:1_____loyalty:3	0_____1_____0_____0_____1

so first, you did not do anything wrong by turning to a male friend. just bc him and your family have told you that(your abusers) doesn’t mean it’s true. he was trying to isolate you from anyone that could help you. it is fine to have friends of the opposite gender. 

second he raped you and continued to violate your comfort. if he pressures you for sex, fights if you say no all that is sexual abuse. 

third, his reaction was extremely violent. punching holes in walls is a sign he could physically abuse you. NOTHING deserves that reaction,
especially something normal like talking to a friend after you were raped. 

fourth, he’s monitoring your every movement. do you know if he’s following your phone location, logging into accounts, cloned your phone? 

fifth, your family are the worst. they are not your support system or safety net. they pushed you into a marriage you weren’t comfortable with. they pressure you to stay with him. and they are helping him abuse you. i’m from a middle eastern family that can be pretty conservative, they would never do this. 

your safety, life is at risk. and when you runaway, you need to runaway from your husband and family otherwise they’ll drag you back to him and won’t have a problem with any treatment he gives you.

Nta at all. but consider which would be an easier way to run away. in your home country or the country you’re going for vacation. yeah your parents will be watching you. but if you keep a bag with all the important papers on you at all times, they won’t expect you to suddenly run off if you have a plan._____. As a plus size woman currently on a weight loss regiment, I can 100% say that fat shaming NEVER actually helps or encourages someone to change(even if they coincidentally do start losing weight, its because of a personal process not shitty comments). So if what he's doing is to encourage you to get healthy, hes doing it all wrong. 

Second, a birthday gift should be what someone wants not something you think they need or to insult them. Even now, if someone gave me a gym membership as a gift, theyre out of my life bc its not their business.

Three, he is emotionally abusive. You are healthy and beautiful. You are at a very healthy bmi and you exercise regularly. What he is doing is insulting you and publicly humiliating you with that shirt. You deserve so much more. And the fact that when you were hurt and crying and explained how it makes you feel, he proceeded to double down is horrible. You're not an asshole but you ae unfortunately married to one._____Yta. You’re taking away an important decision from him and showing a lack of trust. This is something he needs to decide if he’s comfortable being around, and it’s beyond if he loves you or not. Maybe he’s already had someone with addiction issues in his life and has trust issues from that. You not telling him would just make it worse. Or maybe he thinks it’s not something he’d be able to handle. Either way, it’s his choice and you don’t get to make it for him. If you actually respect him, you’ll tell him. He’s not a bad person if he chooses to leave and he won’t be a saint if he stays. It’s just what he can handle and is comfortable with._____
You’re working hard to recover. What he didn’t is the equivalent of pouring you a shot and saying you need to drink it bc in the real world people will drink and not coddle you. He can compliment you without it relating to your body. I’m sure you’re a smart, captivating, strong funny woman with great hair. And the fact that he is crossing a serious boundary for your mental and physical health is horrible. And what real world is he living in where people are constantly coming up to you to make comments about your body? Bc it wouldn’t be ok for random ppl on the street to harass you. And as your bf he should be helping you, supporting you, and yeah a little bit of coddling.
Basically, I’ve counted 5 red flags from him. You don’t need him dragging you down, dump him._____. but i do think you should take him up on this offer, but do make sure you see a therapist that would understand your point of view as a woman of color.

he felt racist because he was being racist. he was also being controlling. if this is a new development, he needs to be recalibrated so he can understand just how hurtful and disgusting his comments were._____Yta. “We basically just treat him like another girl”? What the hell? He’s not trans, he doesn’t identify as a woman. 
Also you need to check your assumptions. Sexuality and stereotyped feminine/masculine traits are not related. Not all lesbians are butch, not all gay men are feminine. And the reverse is true as well. So the only thing from his behavior that’s related to sexuality is gushing over Kpop boy groups. But he could be gay or bi. 

But your reaction was horrible. You don’t need to throw him a party, but a one word response sounds extremely cold and isolating. How is he supposed to know “cool” means “we still like you, we’re happy you trust us to not judge you” and not “we’re in a public place so i can’t say this, but I don’t want to be around you anymore, I’m now uncomfortable around you”. Use your big boy words.

And there’s a BIG difference between “it’s none of our business” and we accept you for who you are and still value you as a friend. Your response sounds like don’t ask, don’t tell. It’s not what friends do. All you had to say is we still accept you, care for you. And the fact that you didn’t says a lot."	care:9,loyalty:2,sanctity:2_____care:4,sanctity:1_____fairness:1,authority:1,sanctity:2,care:1_____care:3,sanctity:1_____care:1,authority:1,fairness:1,sanctity:1_____loyalty:1,fairness:1,care:1,sanctity:1	0_____1_____0_____0_____1

this is a complicated situation. But be really honest with yourself - how would you deal with this if this was one of your parents?

Also, this conversation:

 A few days ago I was at a bar with my friend and discussing my true feelings about the entire situation. The bar was a little loud so I did have to speak up a little bit in order to hold the conversation. I told my friend that I’ve been feeling inundated with these bills ever since the the midpoint of the treatments, and again, although I have put on a smile and want the best for my Wife’s family, internally I wanted the financial bleeding to stop and just wanted my mother in law to die comfortably in hospice care. 

Were you diplomatic and considerate? Did you say anything that could have been misinterpreted?_____

OP, what the fuck?

 I love our life together and don't ever want to risk anything.

So why are you lying to your husband so you could go ""help"" this stupid piece of shit? You literally risked your marriage by:

 letting my boredom guide me into a making a bad choice to having a screaming match in the mall to not telling my husband what happened.

What was the point of that? Don't give time and energy to abusive assholes. To understand why, listen to the ""Dirty John"" podcast. 
_____

 everyone we know except for a few are calling him the asshole for not accepting and being pissed at her.

Seriously? Cheating is cheating, regardless of who she cheated with. 

Do you guys live in a vastly more repressive country than the US currently is or something like that? a hundred years ago I would have had a lot more sympathy for a gay person married to a straight person but in most first world countries people can either be out or just not get married..._____ or , I think. I can understand being upset that your brother stays with someone that cheats on him to this extent, but it sounds like you were seriously trashing this woman before her cheating became known:

 He got married to a woman whom I thought was a terrible match. She has two kids from previous relationships by different men. And she doesn’t work either. And she buys things on amazon constantly.

God, what horrible bitch, having kids and buying things on amazon. Your brother can marry anyone he wants, and how did you think trashing her would go? 

Now, of course, you have new information._____ IMO even if you decided to meet your needs elsewhere without her blessing, you would still not be the asshole provided you were honest about it. I'm not sure you'll be happy about the results of that decision, if you made it, but asshole isn't the word I'd use.

I do disagree with you there - knowing she's not open to an open relationship, he should divorce her before cheating. _____

It's OK to not pity someone for experiencing the consequences of their own actions. I'm not sure what he expected when he told his wife he didn't love her anymore? Divorce is generally what follows.

 And that the guy was a guy who was like a leader in the community and who could be trusted.

How were you supposed to know that? (Though the reality is that ""leader in the community"" doesn't actually mean someone can be trusted. Plenty of leaders in their communities have raped little kids, for example).

I'm really angry that the police, who of all people should have an awareness of the reality of violence, were so dismissive of your concerns for your safety. (And we all know that he was an older white guy and that the police would have responded very differently if he were, for instance, black).

Also, it was the guy who wasted their time, not you._____: why weren't you guys actually supervising him?

Also, am I the only one who thinks it's ridiculous to want to pay $7000 (even if you have enough money that you defnitely have that) for a quarter sized dent?

 He is known for being a little hellion. His current obsession is seeing how hard he can bang his head on things.

Yeah, something like this was perfectly foreseeable.                                Either property damage or an injury. Regardless of how many times he'd come over without damaging anything/hurting himself or others, if he's doing the actions that will cause that sort of thing, it eventually happening is inevitable._____Defending yourself is when you're preventing the person from hurting you further. OP could have defended himself by taking a few steps backward.

 Injuring (or doing something that might injure someone) is only self defense if you have no other means of protecting yourself-in OP's case, it was probably anger/revenge, not self defense._____.

Destroying his phone didn't remove the video. 

And if you're so concerned about your gf's job...why are you hosting a party with illegal drugs in the first place? If you're able to stay sober and your friends can't, sounds like you need a new group of friends._____
 (I’m a nurse so I have a super strong gag reflex.)

And you were doing the exact same thing a nurse would do at work for a patient. And it was every bit as innocent as if it had happened inside a hospital.
 Next morning everyone wakes up and comes to see their friend covered in poop...one of my best friends suggested the passed out girl file a police report.

So first they wake up all eager to see and laugh at her for being covered in poop next they want a police report filed on you. They're not true friends to you or to her._____  It just starts a chain reaction of discomfort.

But if everyone gets to recline their seat, they can avoid a lot of back pain. I'd rather have cramped legs than a sort back.

How have her family been “disrespectful for months” when you’ve only been dating her for 4? And no offense but you’ve been out of jail for only one year, so they have every right to be worried and concerned. I think they’re judging you more on your criminal record than actual jail time, and if a potential employee can do that so can the family of your girlfriend, and after they got to know you, might decide you’re a good person/safe. But responding to a joke(a mean, stupid one) with a serious threat won’t help. How exactly are you understanding when you call him a smartass? You didn’t physically harm him so you were being considerate and generous. And you do know that warning and threat are synonyms right???? A threat is a specific kind of warning to inflict harm on someone. So I’m not sure what you’re arguing._____. unless you’re planning on sponsoring her gym membership, certified personal trainer, professional chef/nutritionist, endocrinologist, insurance, medication: keep your unwanted and uneducated opinions to yourself. 

frankly, you haven’t said that she complains about her health in any way to you. so i have no idea why you’d think she’d want your opinion? her health is between her and her doctor. you can have an opinion about it, i do, but you keep your mouth shut. bc is sure you’re not a perfect angel and wouldn’t want her to start commenting on how you should change that disgusting personality. 

also, don’t comment on her relationships or physical attraction. that is so revolting from you. sometimes i’m jealous of my friends smile(gorgeous lips and perfect teeth), but i’d never  expect her to tell me get braces bc she’s not a monster. 

honestly, i think cutting you out of her life will make her feel the best about herself in years, no one constantly putting her down. there’s physical health and mental health. and you shouldn’t try harming one to improve the other. 

as someone who’s lost 50+ and is continuing to do so, the mentality and self perception is a big part of weight loss. if you start it thinking you’re disgusting, that self hate won’t magically disappear with the pounds. and when the inevitable slip up happens(always does, maybe you miss a few workouts, splurge when you shouldn’t) that deprecating attitude wont stop you from bouncing back because you’ll think you deserve to be miserable and fat=miserable. 

you want to be a friend, support her, do fun things with her. sure, help her be active in a normal way(mile long walk and then a healthy picnic), swimming, yoga, etc. but the pressure, the comments on her size are so unhealthy to her._____yta.
first, you should be supportive of your friend. she got a “better” work offer, so just for that your should be supportive and not lash out. 

second, you’re telling her she doesn’t fit in and it’s already affecting her work chances. again,
you should be happy she found a place that’s more in tune to her personality.

third, that is a toxic and sexist workplace. how is avengers and funko pops more professional than her tools? the first thing that popped in my head is garcia from criminal minds. fantastic at tech and filled with flowery bubbliness. do you really think the tech industry is only filled with sexism and bullying? and if so, don’t you think it’d be better to support a friend and coworker instead of intimidating them and bullying them to conform? 

i know you’re upset. maybe take a deeper look at why. maybe it’s bc you’re upset she managed to get out of that infantile hellhole. maybe it’s because you’re afraid that their already poor treatment of you will get worse bc you were associating with someone that had a feminine display of personality. 

honestly, i’d apologize and see if she can get you an interview._____Yta, and not just for the clickbait title. I don’t know many girls that send “offers” of im assuming smth sexual to a classmate without prior flirting or smth, definitely not as a joke. So either you were flirting with her, or she got the sense that you were available. Also, you said it’s a joke. Did you text her back to say it was inappropriate and have a gf? Or did you ignore it and laugh it off? I’m guessing the second, which is why you’re an asshole and she broke up with you.

 And you should know better than to have mommy fix your relationship. It’s really rude to involve her and disgusting/turnoff. 

The fact that your mom offered tells me she doesn’t see you as a responsible adult either, just a child she’s still cleaning up after. No girl is going to want to get involved with that mess._____Yta. From the very first sentence, my first thought was what an asshole. “She was bi” no she IS bi. She was severely bullied and wants to stand up for herself as an adult and you’re too insecure and homophobic to support her. And just bc she’s with you doesn’t mean she’s no longer a bi or in your words gay woman. Just bc she’s in a heterosexual relationship does not mean she’s heterosexual. 

Also your edit makes you a Massive asshole. You’re equating hair color with sexuality? People aren’t bullied, assaulted, persecuted and commit suicide bc of their hair color. And i can’t believe you’d compare an insulting shirt(i like blondes just seems derogatory to me bc of all the blonde rude stereotypes) to her shirt which is tongue in cheek and with a positive message._____, but you’re an adult. This is something you need to solve for yourself. What professor are you going to tell exactly? This isn’t happening in class, so they don’t care and you’re going to come across as immature and possibly a nuisance, which is not what you want. You can talk to a counselor about it, but again there’s nothing for them to do(at most they’d reach out to her for mediation which she can refuse) You say showing without your consent like that actually means smth, but basically she didn’t do anything illegal or punishable. It’s not like she’s a coworker showing you inappropriate images, that’d be sexual harassment.

If you have a signed rental agreement they have to supply it to you. If you don't, then there's nothing stopping you from moving out and not having to deal with them on this issue. Like I said, stop treating them like your parents and start treating them like your landlords. You have rights as a tenant and in many countries there are organisations out there to help you protect those rights. They're trying to have their cake and eat it too at the moment. They want you to pay them rent but they also want control over your life. It doesn't work like that. _____. People will likely tell you that you don't have a right to privacy while under your parent's roof blah blah blah. But respecting privacy is a core part of respecting a person. If your parents don't respect your privacy then they don't respect you as an individual. If your parents are telling you now that you're not deserving of any respect from them, I don't know what to tell you, because that's a garbage attitude for anyone to have (and the kind of attitude that leads to kids who don't talk to their parents and put them in crooked homes when they get old).

By the time you finish school (which may include postgrad) that thing is probably going to be worthless and next to useless. As a token gesture, it may be worth it to keep them on side, especially if they're controlling the trust that you need for the rest of your schooling. Don't get me wrong, they sound like greedy idiots, but this might be a time to play smart._____. While you certainly aren't entitled to their money, they made a promise and you made plans based on that promise. I think you have a right to be upset with the breaking of a promise no matter what it is, but certainly for something as significant as this. I think you need to be honest with your mother, and sit down with her and look at your options. Can you defer school for a year to work and save money (I didn't go to uni straight after school and it's one of the best decisions I've made in my life)?

I'd say she wasted all her past chances and will probably waste all the future chances. Let me break this down:

   my ex broke up with me a year ago, started seeing this other guy but still didn’t want me seeing other people and kept saying she wanted me but wasn’t ready

There are at least three wrong things already in the first sentence: She's seeing someone else but says you can. She's not seeing you and still wants to control who you see. She says she wants to be with you and is still seeing someone else. 

None of this is healthy.

  She tells me it was a one time thing a month ago (while she was promising nothing was going on) but swears it meant nothing and still wants me and says she’d do anything to take it all back.

There are some things that you just can't take back. If she's with you and cheats there is a level of trust that may be impossible to regain. You might not be able to trust her fully again. You might not want to trust her again. And both of them would be justified.

Also, if it meant nothing, why did she do it?

  So not only am I seriously hurt by all of that, she’s now telling me I shouldn’t be this upset still and how this shouldn’t be a reason not to get back together

Why is she trying to dictate how you feel?

  this shouldn’t be a reason not to get back together because it’s none of my business 

If she wants to be with you, if she wants to be back with you, I would say it is definitely some of your business. 

  and that she didn’t do anything wrong because we aren’t in a relationship

Then you aren't in a relationship and you can decide to stay not being in a relationship. She cannot have it both ways. Either she was trying to get in a relationship with you and she did something wrong, or she wasn't trying to get in a relationship with you and you cannot trust her seriousness about it.

  She plans on getting the pregnancy terminated for the record which I fully understand is very traumatizing for anyone to go through, but for personal reasons I’m not feeling supportive or sympathetic. 

If she, as she says herself, is not in a relationship with you, it's none of your business. It's hers. Her decision, her choice, her burden.

  She’s saying I’m an insensitive asshole because I said I wouldn’t even consider the idea of working through this until she’s no longer pregnant with another mans child

You. Are. Not. In. A. Relationship. She said it herself. Working through this is something you can decide or not to do. The fact that she might abort or not that child is not even the deciding factor, and to be honest I wouldn't consider it even if she aborted it. She has already showed that she isn't reliable under any criteria._____. To be honest, it seems to me that you built an entire story in your head about how he's an evil monster and she needs to be rescued from him by the only one who will ever love her (i.e: you). 

Get some help. _____(Reading your other comments, I should have expected you to take a bad route with this. I don't know what I was expecting)

I'm not saying it's her job, just saying that it's a possibility for her. Because that guy did nothing wrong, yet got hurt as a consequence of her actions (and please don't disregard it as ""fragile ego"". Men's feelings get hurt too and we need to recognize it), so if she can do something to ease his pain AND she is comfortable with it, it would be a kind thing to do.

Also, this entire situation is awkward for her too, that's the original reason of this post. So again, if she's comfortable with this and it can help to diminish the awkwardness, it might be good for her as well. 

(Again, it's not an obligation. It's a possibility. At the end each person needs to come out at their own pace. However, since she already told him that she was bisexual, back when they started dating, it might be feasible.)_____, but I can't help but thinking, you're doing exactly what she wants you to do. She wants your boyfriend to be single to pair him up with the neighbord she seems to be about to to get it.

The only question is whether it's worth it to fight back. That's up to you to decide. Your boyfriend seems to have very little assertiveness regarding his mother, so it could be difficult._____  The fact that she evens cares that much about being “the first” is super weird. 

Imagine being her husband and knowing that she only married you because of the bragging rights._____.

All this being said, you need to stop making light of serious mental disorders.

In addition, stolen items are usually never used and are often returned when the shame kicks in.

I picked OCD off the top of my head, and had no intention of inferring that people with OCD have no control over their actions. Rather, I wanted to point out the ridiculousness of asking someone to just stop doing something that is caused by a mental illness.

It just so happens that OP has food and the roommate can’t help it.

Also I hope you realize that even if the roommate bought extra food (even though they’re not supposed to), OP’s food would probably still get eaten.

The cycles of binging and purging are extremely harmful and isn’t supposed to happen or be allowed to happen.

No one is saying that OP should let the roommate off scot free, we’re saying that OP’s attitude about the roommate’s mental illness is dismissive and insensitive._____

This is a simple lack of communication between the two of you. You consider it important that others ask you before helping themselves to your food. Your roommate likely doesn't share that view, so they don't see it as a problem.

In terms of the actual food, that's a non-issue at this point since it's been replaced. I would, however, advise that you have a discussion with your roommate about food so this doesn't happen in the future._____

You're clearly not helping your brother by doing this, but it's not your intention to hurt him either.

Maybe in future, make your posts about the stuff you get visible to everyone except your brother?

That’s great it’s their dream wedding, you’re not stopping THEM from going, but why in gods green earth would YOU go?? Why would you put yourself at risk? Yes, everything will PROBABLY be ok, but you’re DEFINITELY not getting arrested if you stay home! The laws were written for gay men, ok, where in the law does it say that? It’s not POLITICAL, it’s another country’s law! Political would be not going because they love Trump or something, they’re going to a place you’re not welcome a lawyer the law!! Really, it’s not a big deal for them to have their dream wedding without you_____, I remember that post!!! Amy is an insipid selfish self centered horrible brat. Who TF cares about this wedding? Weddings are supposed to be a time for people who love you to get together and celebrate a milestone in your life, they are meant to include everyone you love, it’s not a time to dictate every aspect of a persons appearance and life just so they can meet some “vision.” Stay home. Tell the whole family that you were not allowed to come to the celebration because of your hair. For one thing, with that much hair, a wig isn’t going to work, for another, there’s not a damn thing wrong with you and your hair the way it is! If she doesn’t want you there the way you are, she doesn’t want you there_____. Let me also say an unpopular viewpoint. Funerals are for the living. The person gone doesn’t care anymore, you go to a funeral to show the family how much you respect them and their loved one. If these people are as horrible as you say, don’t waste your money and your time. Have your own saying goodbye ceremony, and apologize that something has come up and you’re unable to go. _____. In many ways, I understand how you feel! It is your big day too, and you should have some input. However, the input should not be to kick her sister out of the wedding party. That is where you have crossed the line. You could have asked your wife if she would be willing to get a colored shawl or belt or something to help differentiate, But instead you have jumped fully on board to throwing a temper tantrum that her sister is going to be wearing a white dress at the wedding. I guess, if this is your hill to die on, it is your choice, but I would be very sad deciding not to marry somebody because of the color of the bridesmaids dress that she chose._____Nta. Man, I HATE how weddings have morphed into this fake “perfection,” thing. It’s supposed to be a celebration of love and joining together. I had a friend get married, and she had so much make up, dyed hair, extensions, and eyelashes, tape, corsets, etc that she didn’t look like herself! She dieted and lost well over 40 lbs “for the wedding.” We went to a party at her house once, and one of the ladies there thought that her husband had an portrait up of his wedding to a different woman. She asked me, “What happened to Jim’s first wife? Why does he still have their bridal portrait hanging?”_____Yta, she’s wearing the dress, but with modifications that honor her religious beliefs. You care more about “the look,” of some pictures than you do your relationships, your sisters comfort, or a persons religious beliefs. Why is your party more important than her lifestyle? It’s awfully selfish to say, “Put aside your core beliefs and values so I can have a bunch of pictures that look nice.” Especially since you’re probably going to keep these pictures forever, and display them everywhere, so her body will be on display much longer than just the few hours for your party.	care:1,fairness:3,authority:1,sanctity:1,loyalty:1_____care:2,loyalty:2,sanctity:1,authority:1_____loyalty:1,authority:1,care:2,sanctity:1_____care:2,sanctity:1,authority:1,loyalty:1_____care:1,loyalty:3,sanctity:1_____authority:1,care:2,sanctity:2	1_____0_____0_____1_____0

YES IT IS!!! pull your head out your ass and take some bloody responsibility here. everything that is happening with your sister is YOUR  fault because you refuse to put on your, ""this is my wedding"" hat and tell your in-laws no. you don't sound mature enough to be married if you can own your own choices and decisions. grow up._____!! you went way too fucking far, OP. while  can sort of see telling him to get out so you both can avoid trouble, everything else was overboard. you DO NOT get to decide who you sister dates, you DO NOT get to deciide who she spends time with, you DO NOT get to tell her who she can fuck(illegal or not. a lot of places have romeo and juliet laws so neither of them would get in trouble legally), you DO NOT get to keep someones clothing cause stealing is wrong(and unless you're in flo/cali, you do not leave smeone outside in the middle of the fucking winter mostly naked. frostbite and hypothermia can happen quick and can be deadly), you DO NOT get to decide who comes in your house during the day(that is up to your parents) and you DO NOT  act like a giant asshole by threatening violence(he could go to the cops for that already, do not add assault/battery to your life). YOU ARE NOT YOUR SISTERS KEEPER!! you don't own her and her vagina so stop acting like you do. this is the kind of thing that ruins sibling relationships. you acted like an authority in her life when you very much are not. at that tiny of an age difference, you are her equal, nothing more. you should hope for your sake that you're so straight edged they could use you for a ruler cause after acting like you did you are now in her sights and she will possibly take advantage of that to make your life miserable. you ok with her acting towards you how you acted towards her??_____!! thank you for helping this young girl who had no control over her situation/life circumstances. she didn't ask for any of this and, while i get why everyone is upset, i can not abide the coldness they are showing her. while your brothers pain is valid, i do not think it fully compares to a 7 yr old losing almost everyone she called family in one go, and it sure as hell doesn't compare to losing her mommy on top of that. she needs love, care and stability, not a system that could leave her worse off. she does not deserve to be fucked over for her moms shittiness."	fairness:1,loyalty:1,authority:1,care:7_____care:4,loyalty:1,fairness:2,authority:1_____care:6,sanctity:2_____care:3,authority:2,sanctity:2,fairness:1_____fairness:3,care:3,authority:2_____care:5,loyalty:1,authority:1	1_____0_____0_____1_____0

if she fell and possibly miscarried, would you have felt any better? i’m betting no bc while you hate the woman you are not a monster. i understand, she’s a vile creature. but in this scenario, you didn’t act much better, where you were willing to put the life of an innocent child in danger so you wouldn’t have to touch her. if she fell, would you have let her lay there or walk over her bc you couldn’t stand to be near her or touch her? i’m not saying if she fell it’d be your fault, you didn’t push her, but most people wouldn’t consider you an innocent bystander. 

for life, everybody sucks._____. You made a choice, and while it’s not bad(like missing the birth of a child for a slurpee), it still has consequences. The consequences are that right now your wife and her family don’t see you as a dependable father since you missed Day 1 when she said she NEEDED you and it was an early delivery. I’m assuming she’s pissed(rightfully so) and i wouldn’t recommend showing her this post to say “see i made the right decision” that’d probably be the nail in the coffin. Hopefully she can get past this, but i personally wouldn’t.

Also, from your wife’s POV, you could have made up with your dad at an earlier time, put in that effort instead of waiting until the literal last minute. And you said you weren’t close to your dad, so to her it sounds like you chose to be with someone you don’t like and may not make up with instead of support her. 

Tbh i don’t think you thought this out well. Would you still think it was the right decision if you and your dad didn’t resolve the issues? If he didn’t die? If your wife had serious complications in labor? If either your wife or child died? If any of those very possible scenarios you think you made the wrong decision, then you made the wrong decision a the time bc you had no idea what could happen and they each could have occurred._____Yta. Hope you’re writing the check for child support now. You don’t know for sure that this baby is yours and you destroyed this family. Are you willing to step up and be a father or did you just want to open your big mouth? _____basic politeness is helping a pregnant woman down the stairs so she doesn’t fall and hurt herself or harm her baby_____I dont think it was appropriate for you to tell other people your parents private news. Especially considering your mother’s age and the increased risk of a miscarriage, that was a gross overstep and makes . 

You don’t need to agree with what they’re doing, you protected yourself as your should. But that was way too far.

Imagine if they do lose the baby. They now have to tell people that they know didn’t want them to have it in the first place. That really pushes the knife in even further.

Whether or not she can control what she does (and if she really does have DID [which kind of blows my mind, that's rare and controversial to say the least] she might not be able to) you are allowed to protect yourself from people that are harming you. 

For a long, LONG time, I was really hung up on the concept of responsibility - my dad was/is an alcoholic and abused my sister and I pretty viciously. I was obsessed with whether or not I could forgive him, and whether or not his behavior was his ""fault"" or not. If alcoholism was a disease, wasn't he NOT responsible, so was I the asshole for being upset about it?

A really wise therapist completely changed that question for me. She asked me to think of my dad as a rabid dog. Is it the dog's fault that they're attacking me? no, because they have rabies. But do I still need to protect myself from that dog? Yes, I do. I can't stand still and LET the dog attack me simply because the dog doesn't know any better. So think of your sister as a rabid dog - maybe she can't help what she does, maybe she can. But either way, you have a responsibility to protect yourself and your family from the harm she does.

so now that I've said all that - when was she diagnosed with DID, and what do her doctors think caused it? from everything I've read, DID is usually associated with severe trauma, which doesn't seem to jibe with your recounting of a safe childhood._____ (or maybe , it seems to me that your step-mom is misinformed or misguided here)

You can't reason with an addict. As a person who grew up with a violent alcoholic father, please get yourself to Al-Anon meetings (support group for friends and family of alcoholics), it is really, REALLY helpful. There's also r/alanon here and probably a bunch of other subreddits that could be helpful to you._____

But don't do it without her consent - yet. Try to get through to her and enlist the help of others, like a pediatrician. or show her this post and all our responses:

OP's wife - I understand you love your dog but your dog is legitimately endangering your child. Pull your head out of your ass._____

sorry, I'm going to start with (as you didn't want) saying this isn't your problem really, it's your parents' problem. (Why can't you all go out to eat together and she can still get something vegan? I don't get that. I can totally understand being annoyed that she refuses to sit in the family car...)

If you're concerned about her health, do some research and help her find recipes that will get her all the nutrients she needs._____Consider it a badge of honor that a shitty racist thinks ill of you. Do you want a racist asshole to think well of you? Nope!

I'd also like to point out that you tried to resolve this several times, and that the school had received reports of her racism from other families. This is entirely on her._____

Why would she shame a little kid for crying? that's pretty fucked up. 

That said, it sounds like she felt she was put on the spot and that she just screwed up, to some degree. Sometimes in parenting, I've found things coming out of my mouth that were things my parents said to me (like getting annoyed with one of my kids for making a giant brouhaha over something that could only matter to a child) that I know are fucked up and dumb things to say, but because I'm worked up for whatever reason (like your wife was worked up, worrying about her son being homesick, etc) they just kind of fly out of my mouth. I have always caught myself pretty much immediately and apologized and corrected myself, but I've had fucking YEARS of therapy too. 

I would go talk to your wife, and ask her about the origin of that comment. Was that something her parents said to her? What was she feeling when she said it? Would it be so bad if the neighborhood kids did find out that a nine year old kid was homesick and upset their first time at sleepaway camp?  Try to draw her out about why she said it, what was she trying to achieve, etc."	loyalty:1,care:8,authority:2,sanctity:3_____authority:1,loyalty:2,sanctity:3,care:2_____care:4,loyalty:2_____authority:1,loyalty:2,care:2_____loyalty:1,authority:1,fairness:2_____care:3,loyalty:1	1_____0_____0_____0_____0

That's not at all what she said or what he said. 

 My wife is saying that I get one on one time with our son and this is an opportunity for her to do the same. I think it is a good idea for her to bond with our kids one on one too.

She claims she wants to go alone because she she wants time to bond with the mentioned son, despite having 4 days off a week alone. Not about the other kid who was only mentioned in passing.

Yet she's not even going with them alone. She's also going with her friend and her friend's kid/kids.
 
When dad goes, it's after work or weekends, and he also must take both kids.

She admits the friend actively discludes him on a regular basis.

 Every time this friend wants to get together with my wife, she never wants the family to be included. It's always dinner and drinks with the girls, beach trip with only the kids-no husbands allowed and now, she wants to my wife to bring our son to Legoland for the weekend and I am not permitted to go.

  I asked her if she could name a single one of my friends that makes her feel excluded and unwelcome and she can't. She recognizes that her friend always wants it to be a girls only or no husbands type of deal but justifies it as ""I don't have very many friends I want to hang out with.""

What speaks about her character is that she says it's unfair she he takes the child in question to the zoo and beach and she wants time with him too. But she has 4 days off! Dad is spending time with him after work and some weekends. He has 2 days off. What speaks about her character is that due to him being upset she's going without him, she calls him names and tries to make him feel like a villain. He says he just wants her to understand how he feels. There is zero evidence he's controlling or an asshole. All we have to go on is what he tells us. Making up plausible scenarios isn't going on the facts we have. So we can only say ""based on this, I feel this."" Logic based on given facts.



_____
Your wife ""won't work"" and here you were working 7 am to midnight, and she's not only refusing to do laundry, dishes, and clean the bathroom, but she expects you to do it at midnight?? You were working two jobs for her lazy ass. Now you finally work one job, and you come home and make your own dinner and take care of the kids. Not together. Just you. While she stares at the t.v and you rub her legs? if she had a job, you'd both be responsible for taking care of your kids after work.
You are a doormat who has done this to yourself. She's a lazy hypoctite. But you let this happen. You have been working yourself to death rather than stand up for yourself. Guess what?  If you divorced her, she'd need to get a job. Stop letting her walk all over you._____He is working 12 hour days and coming home to take care of the kids after. She has a nanny taking care of the kids for almost the entire day and refuses to help him get sleep to rest for a potentially dangerous job. At this point she could easily still work outside the home. But this is a waste of my time . Not interested in arguing with people just because they don’t like differing opinions or who think the wife gets a pass because she gave birth. Enjoy arguing with everyone you disagree with._____.
Your wife seems very damaged, but she took her family's side after they made it clear they didn't care about her. Your FIL is behaving on a paranoid and insane way. I'd honestly cut off all future contact. Yourself and any future kids. Tell your wife now that you don't want your kids around them.
Curious why you didn't report them to the church. His behavior is toxic. _____
It’s the multiple failed businesses that changes it from . 
She said she got to make the financial decisions because she made more, and he accepted it. Now he makes more and he said it’s only fair he gets to decide. She called him an asshole and cried. While the decisions should not be only one or the other, they should be BOTH, he accepted it when she disagreed. That makes her unfair and a hypocrite. He should not have put up with her controlling financial decisions and telling him it’s because she made more, but he agreed to it. Making her the asshole for being a giant hypocrite when the tables turned. He put her through multiple failed businesses, but it sounds like she never used that as her reasoning, which is a little odd. In the end he cannot be the only asshole because he is doing exactly what she did._____
She shouldn’t have been trying on her clothes. She had no business doing that.
However. You seem more concerned with giving your kids a mother, and that’s not really fair to her. You should marry her because you love her and can’t imagine life without her. Yet you tell her she can only put her clothes in the closet if there’s room with all of your deceased wife’s clothes in there.
Grieving has no time limit and you absolutely should feel free to keep her clothes as she left them for as long as you need. But at the same time, you can’t bring in your new almost wife and tell her she can’t have closet space. 
I’d say you aren’t ready yet. Give yourself and your kids time to adjust to life without her, and move your new partner in when you are actually ready.

 I worked at Target for over a year 

Well, I guess it can depend on what type of store you're working at. Sure, I guess if you're in a Target or Walmart, it's usually how you're describing it. (I assume you were on the floor, getting asked random questions?-if you'd been at customer service taking returns and dealing with a long line, having a coworker dealing with half that line would make a difference.) As for whether the original OP would be causing problems for coworkers, I have a second job in a grocery store, and based on what I've seen, it'll probably depend on which specific department he works in.

I work at a fabric store, and mostly stand behind a counter cutting fabric. That customer can't buy the fabric without me either cutting it or measuring it for them.  If I'm helping customer number 1, and don't have a coworker to help customer number 2, customer number 2 is going to just to wait in line. Same for customer number 5, 6, 14, 21...

There is no scenario where telling the customer ""I'm busy"" will result in them walking away and not waiting for my help.

And if I'm working a closing shift, I have to have all the bolts of fabric (which we were cutting from) put away before I leave. If I don't, I'm getting fired. If my coworker is there, one of us can put bolts away while the other cuts for customers. If she doesn't show up, the bolts pile up, and I have to take care of this huge pile after the store closes.



We were talking about kitchens too, do you think they get to just tell a customer ""I'm busy"" and then just never serve them?_____ but I was careful to be respectful and phrase my complaint as a suggestion they train people better rather than a criticism of the particular employee.

, and I say this as an employee in retail who meets my fair share of asshole customers.

And the kid's job is in less jeopardy due to this complaint from you than it will be if someone calls back irate because, due to following his advice, they really did kill their lobsters. It's in the manager's hands now, and we can only hope that he has the common sense to teach that kid what to say.

(edited to fix typo)_____It would be one thing if he'd just ordered the wrong food and wanted a refund, (though even in that case he'd be entitled to that refund).

He was yelling and cursing, and, far worse, lying about one of your waitresses, would have gotten her in trouble with a worse manager/owner.

_____Former nanny here, just so you know that any bias I'd have would be in favor of the nanny and against the employer:

You are very much . Keeping her in your household could have caused you serious harm, and is that really the type of person you want caring for your daughter?

Look at it this way, now there's a job opening for someone else who probably needs it just as much. You should be fair to any nannies, but you have to put the well being of you and your daughter first._____ 
  I told her if this had been a male doing it, we would have excluded him too.

That doesn't make a difference. You acted horrifically wrongly regardless of whether your motivation had anything to do with gender. 

Was the ability to use cursing sooo important to you? (and you're clearly unprofessional in that you must not care much about the company or getting things done if you're instructing people not to help this one pseron solely in order to sabatoge them so that you can get back to cursing).

If this was purely a cultural thing he would be the asshole, but this is a significant religious thing too. It doesn't matter whether he's an atheist or religious, it's not fair to expect him to participate in a religious ceremony that he doesn't believe in. Your mother does and the others do, and that's their choices, but it should be his choice as well. I personally don't think you should have put him in that position in the first place. It would be like expecting a non-Catholic to take communion or to say grace._____. You have no obligation to provide for any of these people especially if they, and your relatives that invite them, are not appreciative of what you do. Not only would I refuse to invite these people, I'd start culling family who come in, eat, watch TV and leave. At the very least they should be bringing something or helping clean up, and they should absolutely be saying thank you. Further, if they would pool their resources and work together they could probably create an even better Christmas than the one you're providing (not shitting on your Christmas, but with all the extra manpower and a collection of funds they should be able to work miracles) so the whole thing reeks of entitlement and laziness. _____ for a few reasons in my mind:

1. Keeping tabs on gifts like it has to be an equal exchange. ""more than I've received from them"" ""more expensive than those they've given me"". Gifts should be given freely, without condition or expectation, and certainly without resentment.
2. As much as I help out family when I visit and they'll reciprocate, you cannot have the expectation that they will. A guest is never expected to do chores. That's just how it is. It's lovely when they do and a nice thank you, but unless they're staying on an extended visit (like a few weeks or a few months while they get stuff sorted out) it can't be expected.
3. If you want them to help out when they're staying for a longer period of time it shouldn't just be applied to your MIL. A 14-year-old is plenty capable of doing things other than playing on his phone, and you didn't mention the husband not having arms or legs.
4. It's a wine glass. Get yourself one of those dish brushes that store the detergent in the handle. A little hot water, a quick once over and a rinse and you're done. It's a 2-second job. And your wife is right, you should clean up after yourself._____My issue is the prayers. Once you add prayers into something, you can't handwave the religious aspect. I'm a Catholic (a really bad one) and I'll participate in my Jewish and Hindu friends' events. But I can absolutely understand someone not wanting to do so, especially since he was handed a prayer to read and prayers are by their nature religious. As I said, I'm in the camp of people who would have participated, but I can understand why someone wouldn't. I kind of wonder though how it would have turned out if he had been given something other than a prayer to read._____. Not eating pork is his choice. You don't bring it into the house and you don't order it when you go out which I think is hugely respectful of him considering you don't share his beliefs. He is being completely unreasonable to expect you to go to your grandmother's house and not eat the food she prepared because of his beliefs. _____. You did your best in order to try and make him happy and now he wants to act like a child because it wasn't up to his standard. Further, if tradition is so important he can start forking over the cash for the wedding. It pisses me off when people start picking and choosing which traditions are convenient to them while ignoring the ones that might involve a little time, effort or money on their part.

maybe you’re too young to remember the cause for “it gets better”. young teens lost after being bullied for their sexuality was a daily thing you’d see on the news. ppl like you constantly bullying and provoking and hurting. and it wasn’t to only teens that were out but to ppl like your brother who weren’t safe or ready to make that choice yet. this was just 10 years ago. and it still happens today. 

1. is being gay funny or smth to ridicule for you, why?
2 what “behavior” or things he said made you think he was gay? were you just going off stereotypes?
3. why are you picking being gay as smth to bully your brother with? 
4. why wouldn’t you support your brother if you thought that was a possibility 
5. why were you avoiding saying this in front of your parents; have they said homophobic potentially violent or hate filled comments?

you are homophobic. you’ve done a huge disservice to your brother. and instead of apologizing and offering support you’re playing the victim that you’re innocent bc you didn’t know he was actually gay.

even if he wasn’t gay you were still bullying him! this just makes it worse. this is basic empathy. and while i would explain with an analogy for you, frankly i’m too annoyed to not make it insulting.

isn’t this nearly exactly what kevin spacey did? 
let’s be clear. ops sister is a monster. she is harassing someone for months continuously in their own home. she is abusive and terrorizing, even after continuous nos. op,  for protecting your fiancé from her harasser. your sisters actions are vile. when someone says no, that needs to be respected, not ignored bc you don’t want to make them uncomfortable._____Yta. What is wrong with you? Seriously, you need professional help. You believe that your bil cheated on your friend and is abusive to your sister with no proof! And then you make a heinous accusation against them that can tear their family apart. Are you lonely and need attention, because this is incredibly toxic behavior. What makes you think you know your sister is being abused or that BIL is a a cheater, your intuition? Take some probiotics bc that gut is rotten. Honestly, at least your family can cut you out and finally have peace(hopefully)._____she wants to protect them she can contact CPS. her aunt and cousin have 0 power to do anything to help their siblings. 

it was simply a move to shame and embarrass them. and it’s NOT ops news to share, whether she’s happy or not for them. it’s a gross overstep._____Respect is not commanded it’s earned. And given the fact that he threatened the brother and was arrested for conspiracy to commit murder I’m not sure the brother would welcome this conversation._____ 
You want to provide a stable home for your nephews. 
Your sister seems abusive and violent, why didn’t she get charged with assault for hitting your parents?

Your disagreement with my judgment doesn't mean I can't read or process what you wrote.  I don't really care if you downvote me, I'm not a sensitive kid on the internet.

A place that serves food shouldn't have to inform you that you aren't welcome to eat your outside food there.  It's a common sense policy, you don't need to have your hand held to know that.  What restaurant allows you to bring your own food when they serve their own food?  They were nice enough not to ask you to leave the first time, but that's still not the same as them telling you that you can eat your outside food there.  Reasons to bring your own food to a restaurant include a severe allergy that can't risk cross-contamination (while your companion still purchases a meal from their menu), bringing something to eat for a small child, or walking back into the place to eat food that you had initially bought to go.  It's a private business, not a place for you to advertise something they don't serve and don't profit from.  You don't have to go there if it doesn't work for you, but  for ignoring a common sense policy of which they shouldn't need to inform you.  

I wasn't harsh on your wife, her spills are completely her own fault.  Yeah, she spilled, but what does that have to do with the coffee shop?  You can't blame any of that on the business, the coffee is her responsibility when it's in her hands._____First off, congrats on the new baby!!

.  Their existence as a customer doesn't mean that you're a slave.  If you weren't taking custom orders, why would they think you'd accepted their order?

A reopened tab doesn't list anything about the payment unless there's a card authorization.  The ""cash due"" line on the bartender printout will list a number $20 less than it should be from that closed out tab so there will essentially be an extra $20 in the drawer.

Managers can often get away with voiding a $20 bill as waste consumption in the event of a walkout, but $50 is too much to get away with.  The fact that the manager left early instead of counting out the drawer to find the discrepancy makes me think it's more theft than favoritism._____.  You were honest about being in CAP, not enlisted.  You didn't ask for the discount, it was offered.  If a fast food discount that you didn't ask for is stolen valor, steal all of that tasty, tasty valor._____It's not rude at all to let the board know that you're struggling to access the courses because of the program itself.  It's the truth and they ought to know.  Your school may actually have more leverage with the company for a faster fix or even be released from an unfulfilled contract if they have proof of inaccessibility.  This can also help to protect you in case you get a 0 on an assignment you can't submit through no fault of your own._____, but I think you need to have a different conversation. When's the last time you had a raise? If you've been somewhere for 10 years where you consistently need to do 10-15 hours of overtime both to live and because your restaurant needs a manager on duty, you're understaffed and your pay rate should be renegotiated.

After 10 years of loyalty, you either need to move to another company that will pay you enough to live comfortably on a 40-45 hour schedule (I know restaurant needs vary, 11 years industry myself).

On the other hand, if you're tight with money and your job is protecting the company's finnances, I understand your point, particularly when this might be taken advantage of.

. Absolutely.

Coming out can be a terrifying process and having your trust broken during it can be a horrible experience. If someone told you in confidence and asked you not to tell it and then you went and tell someone, it doesn't matter how trustworthy that someone is, you just proved that YOU are not trustworthy. 

Particularly when you opened the door by first posting the snapchat story, basically shouting to the world that you had a secret, then someone asked you and you told them, and then went and bragged to your friend that you had broken her trust.

Now, for this girl in particular her accident could have been the WORST thing that's EVER happened to HER specifically.

That's not fucking how eating disorders work, educate yourself so you understand.

There's also the chance that besides what the manager said, they may go in a different direction in which case you'll look like a prick. _____

For you, fellow commander, a breakdown of the texts (remember they've been talking for a week at this point).

  

· He’s talking about him and his friends

· OP brings up that it stressed her out

· He says it’s not 50 people, it’s only like 12

· She says “I’m slightly worried you’re never going to stop introducing me to your friends”

· He has a ??? moment and tries to figure out why that’s even a concern at this point

· She claims he wouldn’t understand because he’s an extrovert

· He seems like he’s getting annoyed

· She’s banging on about how stressful it is

· He points out that they aren’t even a couple yet tells her to figure out what it is she wants

· She can’t deal with this right now, claims he gets irritated easily

· He claims she’s twisting things to suit her argument and that she makes everything about her

· She denies it then says if he wants to fix this to call her once he’s relaxed

· He claims he didn’t break anything and that there’s nothing to fix

· He says it’s done, delete photos of him

· She wants to talk about it and end it over a call

· He says no, he’s basically done, calls her toxic

· She says for him to delete any pictures of her too

· Thumbs up emoji from him_____. You invaded his privacy, blew up at him after saying you wouldn't, then have the audacity to say his messages are ""too clean"".

 because I feel like its one more step toward being an adult,

from a lady who is old enough to be your mom......here's a hint on adulthood since you seem so keen on it. adults understand, unless they have been extremely spoiled and ended entitled that is, the world does not revolve around them, not even on their birthday. they understand others have lives and responsibilities(such as your dad attending to a grieving child) and can not spend every second with them nor drop what they are doing to do so. they have empathy and compassion and realize others pain my trump themselves, even if it's only over a rat(which by the way, is not just a rat to your brother. it was something he loved greatly, it was his friend and companion. imagine if you lost a friend and your family told you to just get over it because you had more. doubt you'd be too happy) and even on their birthday. basically, adults realize they aren't so special and that the world doesn't stop spinning in order to cater to them. adult is not just a number but also a mindset. you might be a yr closer to the number but you are far from the mindset.

you're sister is right. pull your head out of your ass. go tell your brother you're sorry for the loss of his pet, give him a hug and then get over yourself. the only person who ruined your birthday was you and your shitty attitude. you still had things on your birthday even if it wasn't a 24 hr OP fest. be grateful and thankful for that._____!! grow up, deal with your bruised ego and stop being an asshole to your son. it's a fucking PHOTO!! he's not asking you to kiss her or something. you don't even have to stand next to her for god sake. do you care more about your 15 yr long anger fest or your son that i assume you love?? he doesn't want you back together. he wants his father to pull his head out his butt for one bloody day!! it's been 15 years and he's probably exhausted with your BS surrounding your ex. unless she murdered your entire family in front you the way you are acting is bloody foolish and immature. look, i get it, divorce sucks and it hurt you but there comes a point where you need to move the fuck on and stop letting your hurt affect those around you. move on and stop expecting people to cater to your nonsense. you might find a point where your sons just stop including you because they are tired of the bs. i get that it's not easy to be in the same space as someone you hate. i do, i've had to do it myself but guess what?? i sucked it the fuck up. it's one bloody day!!!_____!! you did nothing wrong. you just wanted you mom to feel better. your dad needs to chill out a bit. your mom isn't going to get addicted smoking a few puffs of a joint. it takes a lot more than that, if it happens at all. and to be frank, if it helps in the end with your moms pain he should be thankful and happy. he shouldn't want his wife to suffer. the only other option beyond suffering is pain killers and if he's so damn worried about addiction he wouldn't want those. your mom though should have more brains in her head and know not to smoke it in a minors room._____!! he was just trying help you, ffs. don't take your anger at your bio-dad out on the man who has always been there for you. don't treat people who give a rat's ass about you like shit. if you can afford it and have access it's beyond time for you to get into therapy and deal with the hurt caused by your bio-dad not giving two shit's about you. i know you're hurting because you had hoped that for once in his life your dad would actually give a shit but it's time to admit, it's been 25 yrs. if he actually cared he would have shown it long before now. you need to let go of the fantasy and deal with the reality. you need to move on and heal your hurts and broken heart before you fuck up a loving, caring relationship. 

go. apologize to fred sincerely with no trying to downplay it. you hurt him because you were hurting but that is not ok._____!! holy shit, OP, could you be anymore callous. are you sure you don't regret your decision because those words sound very resentful and angry. find some damn empathy and put yourself in his shoes for five frigging seconds. imagine having your bio father being in jail most of your life and having your bio mom just leave you. wouldn't you feel some kind of way about it?? most people would regardless of the fact they have a loving family. he was abandoned by the very people who should have never abandoned him. it's gonna hurt no matter what. he's right you don't get it and you need to learn to try to. apologize to him immediately. get him to therapy so he can work out his feelings. get yourself, as a family, into therapy so you all can work out the problems and so you can truly understand his side of things. he loves you, cares for you and appreciates everything you've done(even if he hasn't said it)but he has a right to express his feelings without people being dicks about it. he needs you to listen and understand it without being offended."	fairness:3,sanctity:2,loyalty:2,care:4,authority:1_____sanctity:2,loyalty:2,care:6,authority:1_____care:4,loyalty:2,authority:1,sanctity:2_____care:5,sanctity:3,loyalty:1_____sanctity:1,care:8_____loyalty:1,authority:1,care:5,sanctity:1	0_____0_____0_____0_____0

I'd say she wasted all her past chances and will probably waste all the future chances. Let me break this down:

   my ex broke up with me a year ago, started seeing this other guy but still didn’t want me seeing other people and kept saying she wanted me but wasn’t ready

There are at least three wrong things already in the first sentence: She's seeing someone else but says you can. She's not seeing you and still wants to control who you see. She says she wants to be with you and is still seeing someone else. 

None of this is healthy.

  She tells me it was a one time thing a month ago (while she was promising nothing was going on) but swears it meant nothing and still wants me and says she’d do anything to take it all back.

There are some things that you just can't take back. If she's with you and cheats there is a level of trust that may be impossible to regain. You might not be able to trust her fully again. You might not want to trust her again. And both of them would be justified.

Also, if it meant nothing, why did she do it?

  So not only am I seriously hurt by all of that, she’s now telling me I shouldn’t be this upset still and how this shouldn’t be a reason not to get back together

Why is she trying to dictate how you feel?

  this shouldn’t be a reason not to get back together because it’s none of my business 

If she wants to be with you, if she wants to be back with you, I would say it is definitely some of your business. 

  and that she didn’t do anything wrong because we aren’t in a relationship

Then you aren't in a relationship and you can decide to stay not being in a relationship. She cannot have it both ways. Either she was trying to get in a relationship with you and she did something wrong, or she wasn't trying to get in a relationship with you and you cannot trust her seriousness about it.

  She plans on getting the pregnancy terminated for the record which I fully understand is very traumatizing for anyone to go through, but for personal reasons I’m not feeling supportive or sympathetic. 

If she, as she says herself, is not in a relationship with you, it's none of your business. It's hers. Her decision, her choice, her burden.

  She’s saying I’m an insensitive asshole because I said I wouldn’t even consider the idea of working through this until she’s no longer pregnant with another mans child

You. Are. Not. In. A. Relationship. She said it herself. Working through this is something you can decide or not to do. The fact that she might abort or not that child is not even the deciding factor, and to be honest I wouldn't consider it even if she aborted it. She has already showed that she isn't reliable under any criteria._____. To be honest, it seems to me that you built an entire story in your head about how he's an evil monster and she needs to be rescued from him by the only one who will ever love her (i.e: you). 

Get some help. _____(Reading your other comments, I should have expected you to take a bad route with this. I don't know what I was expecting)

I'm not saying it's her job, just saying that it's a possibility for her. Because that guy did nothing wrong, yet got hurt as a consequence of her actions (and please don't disregard it as ""fragile ego"". Men's feelings get hurt too and we need to recognize it), so if she can do something to ease his pain AND she is comfortable with it, it would be a kind thing to do.

Also, this entire situation is awkward for her too, that's the original reason of this post. So again, if she's comfortable with this and it can help to diminish the awkwardness, it might be good for her as well. 

(Again, it's not an obligation. It's a possibility. At the end each person needs to come out at their own pace. However, since she already told him that she was bisexual, back when they started dating, it might be feasible.)_____, but I can't help but thinking, you're doing exactly what she wants you to do. She wants your boyfriend to be single to pair him up with the neighbord she seems to be about to to get it.

The only question is whether it's worth it to fight back. That's up to you to decide. Your boyfriend seems to have very little assertiveness regarding his mother, so it could be difficult._____  The fact that she evens cares that much about being “the first” is super weird. 

Imagine being her husband and knowing that she only married you because of the bragging rights._____.

test	yelling at my daughter and grounding her	Some phone lines ring twice before going to voicemail if they're turned off. That can be perceived as being sent to voice mail. Referencing my year long experience as a sixteen year old girl, she may have told OP that her phone died because she forgot to call about curfew and used the dead phone excuse. My parents were so gullible that they believed it until I admitted it five years later. _____YTA for yelling, not for grounding her.  It might make you feel better to yell at her, but you just as easily could have explained in a normal tone of voice that she had you worried sick, and you're punishing her for both ignoring her curfew and not letting you know she was going to be late.  You were right to ground her.  Her actions have consequences.

What a nasty way to respond to her happy news.  You are being selfish about her time and going so far as to trash innocent, theoretical kids.  She isn't responsible for treating your agoraphobia.  You are.  She has a life and you want her to drop it to prioritize you.    I'm sorry that you have mental health struggles, but she can't be responsible for getting you out of the house.  He hasn't done anything to harm you, even though he's been disloyal to your sister.  At this point, that's between them.  They may have addressed it and be on a good path.  

Don't throw her away because you're angry at her for moving forward with someone she loves.  You're not protecting her, you're punishing her._____, but for mixed reasons.

I understand that it's painful to spend time with someone who doesn't remember you as you are.  It's awful to watch.  No one teaches you how to navigate the relationships with people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, but there are options to help guide you while you endure this.  Have you sought out therapy for yourself?  I think it could be really helpful for you to seek out support groups or private sessions.  Although your mother is still here, your grieving process has already started.  You may regret not spending more time with her when it's no longer an option._____ for bailing last minute.  If you knew you wouldn't be able to handle the full responsibilities, you really ought to have bowed out gracefully instead of taking on more commitments.  You overextended yourself, and that was an asshole move to them and yourself.  You have to take care of yourself instead of pushing yourself so hard.

PTSD is an actual diagnosis along with anxiety and depression.  Have you been diagnosed by a professional?  Are you in any kind of treatment?  If you're feeling suicidal, please reach out for help.  [Here's a link]( to search for therapists and psychiatrists.  If you're outside of the US, there are country options at the top of the page.  You can also reach out to your insurance company for a list of covered practitioners.  _____.  It's not like you were hospitalized for appendicitis, you were hospitalized for your mental health.  There's still a stigma against mental health issues, notably hospitalization, and it's a very private issue.  You don't need unsolicited advice from her friends.  

Your mom may be sharing with her friends as a way to get their support while he copes with it, she may be sharing it for some attention. Either way, it's not her issue to share.

I hope everything feels better for you soon.  You should be proud of yourself for getting help.  _____It's disgusting to waste medical resources so you can be cruel towards people who just want to live in good health. The recipient may be a failure of a parent and a crappy person, but you shouldn't be proud of cruelty._____We can agree to disagree.  Terminology here isn't really that vital to either of us in the long run, so I'll continue with my way more important point:

If he's not willing to seek mental healthcare, I really encourage you to consider whether you want to stay in this relationship.  Depression sucks.  Agoraphobia is becoming more common during this pandemic.  He may benefit from medication.  If he's already on it, he needs an adjustment. 
 Staying in bed is only going to make him feel worse in the long run and he needs a plan to return to the real world.  Can you go for a distance walk or picnic with a friend?  I think picnics are easier because you can set up far away from one another.  Statistically, you're unlikely to get sick when you go out, especially when you're taking precautions.  

I don't love ultimatums, but ""If you don't get mental healthcare and stick with it, our relationship will not survive.  Call your psychiatrist on Monday, non-negotiable"" is 100% fair here."	care:4,authority:2,sanctity:1,loyalty:1_____care:4,loyalty:1,authority:1,sanctity:1_____care:2,loyalty:3,authority:1_____care:6_____sanctity:3,care:3_____care:3,authority:1,sanctity:1,fairness:1	1_____0_____0_____0_____1

Yes, everything will PROBABLY be ok, but you’re DEFINITELY not getting arrested if you stay home! The laws were written for gay men, ok, where in the law does it say that? It’s not POLITICAL, it’s another country’s law! Political would be not going because they love Trump or something, they’re going to a place you’re not welcome a lawyer the law!! Really, it’s not a big deal for them to have their dream wedding without you_____, I remember that post!!! Amy is an insipid selfish self centered horrible brat. Who TF cares about this wedding? Weddings are supposed to be a time for people who love you to get together and celebrate a milestone in your life, they are meant to include everyone you love, it’s not a time to dictate every aspect of a persons appearance and life just so they can meet some “vision.” Stay home. Tell the whole family that you were not allowed to come to the celebration because of your hair. For one thing, with that much hair, a wig isn’t going to work, for another, there’s not a damn thing wrong with you and your hair the way it is! If she doesn’t want you there the way you are, she doesn’t want you there_____. Let me also say an unpopular viewpoint. Funerals are for the living. The person gone doesn’t care anymore, you go to a funeral to show the family how much you respect them and their loved one. If these people are as horrible as you say, don’t waste your money and your time. Have your own saying goodbye ceremony, and apologize that something has come up and you’re unable to go. _____. In many ways, I understand how you feel! It is your big day too, and you should have some input. However, the input should not be to kick her sister out of the wedding party. That is where you have crossed the line. You could have asked your wife if she would be willing to get a colored shawl or belt or something to help differentiate, But instead you have jumped fully on board to throwing a temper tantrum that her sister is going to be wearing a white dress at the wedding. I guess, if this is your hill to die on, it is your choice, but I would be very sad deciding not to marry somebody because of the color of the bridesmaids dress that she chose._____Nta. Man, I HATE how weddings have morphed into this fake “perfection,” thing. It’s supposed to be a celebration of love and joining together. I had a friend get married, and she had so much make up, dyed hair, extensions, and eyelashes, tape, corsets, etc that she didn’t look like herself! She dieted and lost well over 40 lbs “for the wedding.” We went to a party at her house once, and one of the ladies there thought that her husband had an portrait up of his wedding to a different woman. She asked me, “What happened to Jim’s first wife? Why does he still have their bridal portrait hanging?”_____Yta, she’s wearing the dress, but with modifications that honor her religious beliefs. You care more about “the look,” of some pictures than you do your relationships, your sisters comfort, or a persons religious beliefs. Why is your party more important than her lifestyle? It’s awfully selfish to say, “Put aside your core beliefs and values so I can have a bunch of pictures that look nice.” Especially since you’re probably going to keep these pictures forever, and display them everywhere, so her body will be on display much longer than just the few hours for your party.	care:1,fairness:3,authority:1,sanctity:1,loyalty:1_____care:2,loyalty:2,sanctity:1,authority:1_____loyalty:1,authority:1,care:2,sanctity:1_____care:2,sanctity:1,authority:1,loyalty:1_____care:1,loyalty:3,sanctity:1_____authority:1,care:2,sanctity:2	1_____0_____0_____0_____1

I agree that your father sounds like an unpleasant person... and yes he gave you permission years ago. BUT, you know deep down (hence this AITA post) that if you told him that you were still using the Netflix account, he would not be pleased. So while you may not be convicted in a court of law of theft, morally speaking you're just as guilty. Stop using the account, or tell him that you are and ask if it is okay that you continue. Just because he's a jerk doesn't mean it's okay to ""steal"" from him._____. Your mother is likely partially upset that her mother is dying.

Your dad is correct. You are not his parent and have no right to dole out punishments._____. She had a baby 7 WEEKS AGO. That is a really, really, really tough time for a new mother, even with full time support. She is allowed to decide who can visit and when and fit in visitors between feedings, naps, and changing diapers. So, you'd rather limit the money (that you are obligated to provide by law) if your parents can't see the child? That is just punishing the child and probably an unwise decision._____.

YES IT IS!!! pull your head out your ass and take some bloody responsibility here. everything that is happening with your sister is YOUR  fault because you refuse to put on your, ""this is my wedding"" hat and tell your in-laws no. you don't sound mature enough to be married if you can own your own choices and decisions. grow up._____!! you went way too fucking far, OP. while  can sort of see telling him to get out so you both can avoid trouble, everything else was overboard. you DO NOT get to decide who you sister dates, you DO NOT get to deciide who she spends time with, you DO NOT get to tell her who she can fuck(illegal or not. a lot of places have romeo and juliet laws so neither of them would get in trouble legally), you DO NOT get to keep someones clothing cause stealing is wrong(and unless you're in flo/cali, you do not leave smeone outside in the middle of the fucking winter mostly naked. frostbite and hypothermia can happen quick and can be deadly), you DO NOT get to decide who comes in your house during the day(that is up to your parents) and you DO NOT  act like a giant asshole by threatening violence(he could go to the cops for that already, do not add assault/battery to your life). YOU ARE NOT YOUR SISTERS KEEPER!! you don't own her and her vagina so stop acting like you do. this is the kind of thing that ruins sibling relationships. you acted like an authority in her life when you very much are not. at that tiny of an age difference, you are her equal, nothing more. you should hope for your sake that you're so straight edged they could use you for a ruler cause after acting like you did you are now in her sights and she will possibly take advantage of that to make your life miserable. you ok with her acting towards you how you acted towards her??_____!! thank you for helping this young girl who had no control over her situation/life circumstances. she didn't ask for any of this and, while i get why everyone is upset, i can not abide the coldness they are showing her. while your brothers pain is valid, i do not think it fully compares to a 7 yr old losing almost everyone she called family in one go, and it sure as hell doesn't compare to losing her mommy on top of that. she needs love, care and stability, not a system that could leave her worse off. she does not deserve to be fucked over for her moms shittiness."	fairness:1,loyalty:1,authority:1,care:7_____care:4,loyalty:1,fairness:2,authority:1_____care:6,sanctity:2_____care:3,authority:2,sanctity:2,fairness:1_____fairness:3,care:3,authority:2_____care:5,loyalty:1,authority:1	1_____0_____0_____0_____1

If she wants to not work anymore, then she accepts the terms that you can't afford a nanny or housekeeper anymore, and you will be working extra hours. What's worse, her current job or chores?_____Calm down. It's very simple. They can't afford the housekeeper or nanny, and her exchange for staying home is him working up to 60 hours a week. So yes, 50% of the housework is too much for a man working 12 hour days 5 days a week or 8.5 hour days 7 days a week. If she doesn't want to do it she can stay working and splitting it in half. No one is forcing her to accept._____Again. It is *her* choice. He cannot possibly do any housework with those kind of hours, but he's making the sacrifice because she dislikes her job. She can say no. Single mothers do all the housework. They clean when the little ones are sleeping or playing. If she doesn't want to do it, she's free to keep working. _____If she was working, he *wouldn't* be working those hours. She will *not* be doing his and her share plus working. She won't be working period. Thats what this is about. It is *not* obvious that he's not doing his half. There is zero evidence to suggest that. Right now she has a nanny and a housekeeper and they split the rest. All we know is that she doesn't want to work. We can't assume he is ""gunning"" for anything or being neglectful or lazy. We don't know his hours or hers, we just know that they have a nanny. By that logic we could also assume she is never with the kids and she never cleans or she's lazy. But we don't assume that. 
She wants to stay home, she has to give up the nanny and housekeeper, and he has to be at work 60 to 80 hours. OP cannot handle both, as he will essentially have the hours of 2 full time jobs. _____No, it's her choice to be a stay at home mother or not because it is what she wants according to OP._____It doesn't matter. She wants to be a SAHM. He can't afford to pay a nanny and housekeeper. If that's what she wants, she needs to make a sacrifice. If she kept working, and he took the new position, they'd have enough to keep the nanny and housekeeper, but also increase their hours if needed.

1. She agreed with you last year and said you wouldn't go if they only punished you.

2. All the other couples, even ones younger than you and not together as long shared tents. 

So she went back on her word. She said it was share a tent or you two don't go. Now she's trying to force you to deal with the same bullshit that happened last year.

It would be one thing if other couples weren't sharing. This is hypocritical. 

And incredibly,  she wants you to suck it up and have a miserable time,  and she refuses to let you talk to her family. She wants you to go on a trip with them, but you can't talk to them. 

Sorry but she's acting like an unreasonable brat. I'd tell her she has 3 choices. 

1. You talk to them.

2. She talks to them.

3. You don't go.

There is no scenario where I would let her guilt and bully me into going when I had a horrible time and was treated unfairly. 

Stand your ground. _____  
Reading comprehension. The problem isn’t“slut-shaming” no matter how eager people are to jump on that bandwagon with pitchforks in hand. You stopped inviting her partially because she’s always busy with other guys. But the problem isn’t that she is promiscuous. The problem is that she’s not being safe and she’s upset that the guys she’s sleeping with in hookup capacity, don’t want more than a hookup. She is getting hurt and upset because she’s hooking up with guys and not understanding the concept of casual sex. She’s also being so unsafe that she is having sex with guys she hardly knows without being safe. She almost got pregnant. She’s putting herself at risk for STDs. She’s destroying her self esteem because she wants to be treated as more than a hookup by her hookups. She’s hurting by herself. By all means, enjoy casual sex,  but be safe and accept it for what it is._____
You cannot hide something this big from your girlfriend, something that still bothers you to this day. Can you hide it for 20 years?
Pacifist or not, she needs to understand that war means self defense and protecting yourself. She cannot fault you for protecting your life.
Sit her down and tell her. Now. Tell her that you didn't want to ruin dinner, but there are some dark things you saw in war that not things you like to think about normally. Be honest. The longer you hide it,  the worse it will get. Trust me._____
Text her friends back that if you are an asshole for not being OK with cheating and her telling you she loved her ex, then you are glad to be an asshole.
What a shit therapist to send her back to the guy who was emotionally abusing her. But I guess if she hadn't,  you wouldn't know what a trash person she is. When a person flirts with you and has the nerve to even hug or kiss you on the cheek when you are taken, it's disrepectful not to end it immediately. _____. Sorry I had to stop reading early into her using you and eroding your self respect. 
Red flags are when someone is willing to flirt when they are taken. (Also, you got really cheated on because your gf never trusted you after she caught you crossing lines)
 because she was abusive manipulative trash. You knew it, and went back again and again which lacks common sense, but you were smart enough to eventually GTFO._____
She has issues with them constantly hurting her feelings. Which sounds like it means she frequently vents that she’s hurt and upset. She is isn’t being careful, which is just foolish as far as STDs.
You stopped inviting her because she never spends time with you and you’ve become annoyed with her sleeping with guys and then getting upset they’re using her. 
That’s not “slut shaming”, it’s talking to her about a problem she’s creating for herself. Diseases, pregnancy, and being used. It would be one thing if she was promiscuous and never mentioned how upset she was by how they use her and she was being careful and responsible. But she’s complaining about the consequences of her chosen actions.

test	telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a SAHM I am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore	"YTA.  Being a SAHM is a full time job.  Watching children is a massive job in itself.  If you're going to be lazy on top of cutting the housekeeper and the nanny entirely, your wife is going to be working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  You get a break from your kids.  You get to interact with other adults.  Being a SAHM is worth a housekeeper, a personal chef, a nanny, a driver, and so much more._____He's still an adult and should pick up at home.  Is he not already helping to clean up at home?  He's going to increase the cleaning burden both by firing the housekeeper and deciding that he's not going to help out.  It's just not fair to shove that all onto someone else because they're staying home to raise children.  He and the kids are benefitting a lot from having her as a SAHM, it isn't all about her.  It would be far more reasonable to keep the housekeeper and maybe hire a week so his wife can have some adult time.

Switching an income job for being a SAHM doesn't mean she no longer has any kind of job or work to do._____If you truly believe that finances are completely separate for a married couple with multiple children, you're very mistaken.  He's not buying food for her, he's working and making an income for his family.

The cat had a change in behavior and your husband isn't interested in making sure the cat is healthy or that you're safe.  Cats in pain can be suddenly aggressive and he's neglecting the cat by refusing to take her to the vet.  He, at a bare minimum, needs to order some Soft Paws and put them on her so you don't get hurt._____ aside from the dogs.  You suck to yourself for tolerating this lazy, cheating jerk calling you a bitch.  That's unacceptable.  You're taking care of the dogs as best you can but it's okay if it's too much because your husband's slack falls on you, but you suck if you completely stop caring for them.  They're innocent and the only ones who will really suffer if you stop.  If you are unable to take care of the dogs, rehome them.  If your husband refuses to take care of the dogs, he's welcome to contribute his personal fun money to a dog walker to cover his share of the responsibility._____.  They suck for not taking care of themselves, their home, or their dog.  Don't put all of the cleaning on yourself.

You and other friends can sit them down and let them know that you're all very concerned about how they keep their house.  There's trash everywhere, things are sticky, their dog could get into things that are lying around.  You're not comfortable going over there anymore.  While yes, it's a bachelor pad, they need to take care of it.  The garbage and recycling trucks come more than once a month._____.  You're an asshole for not contacting animal control and watching the neglect, but that isn't the question.  Where are your parents in this?  If your grandparents have a shit covered basement, your parents should look into contacting animal control for neglected animals, your locality's health and safety line, and possibly Adult Protective Services for a wellness check because the house is a biohazard.  You can do all of these things too.

 Telling her that she should discipline her dog, or if she can't do that, put it down.

Or see about finding a rescue that can rehabilitate the dog and adopt out to capable owners.  Putting a dog down is not the next option here.

Change it up to what you can do before your breaking point..  you can work 60-80 hours a week,   and you can help out with meals , dishes, putting kids to bed , yard work, trash, etc.    and once a month clean out some bathrooms.   laundry on weekends  (or what ever your breaking point is)  

&amp;#x200B;

then see what her breaking point is with her job

and what her breaking point is with home chores 

&amp;#x200B;

ask which she would rather do, and see if you can pick up what's gonna break her, and vice versa.     Maybe you can handle diapers, picking up toys, and running the vacuum after work but you don't want to go near a kicthen,    or maybe you don't mind cooking and dishes but you'll hate picking up toys.

like when there's a bee in my car, and i'm waiving my arms around all crazy, saying ""please leave me alone""    but its me rolling down my window that actually got the bee to leave,  not my whinging. :)_____you're not entirely wrong.  and i'm sure there's been some trickle down effects.   someone in the closet might see someone in a pride parade naked and wearing sex toys and decide they can come out to their friends and family, and that person changes minds of straight people. 

Well i'd like the LBGT community to have less violence targeted at them. 
which will only be achieved by changing hearts and minds. 

what happened when we give up on changing hearts and minds?   you end up with the charolettesville march .  

For a long time i just figured racism was just about done and why should i care about changing their minds?   none of my friends are racist,  , and hey They are wrong.   

Well that sort of thinking allows hate to fester, and festering hate leads to violence, and death.  

at least , IMO, that's why we should ALL care about changing as many minds as possible._____Not every unpopular or wrong idea is hate speech.

  

Hate speech is really ""we hate this group of people, and they should suffer violence""

  

Atheists may think i'm delusional (mental condition) for believing in God, but i wouldn't qualify that as hate speech, unless the up to to ""you're delusional, and because of that, we are going to hurt you""

  

sounds like his brother is going on that ""gender dispohria ?""  rant .  but if he's the ""lets get you help"" type .. that's really not hate speech.   its a lot more of mis-guided love speech.

  

which is often worse... people who think they are acting out of ""social good"" are relentless ...  just like tagging opinions you disagree with as hate speech.    its cause you care about society right? _____well then we are gonna disagree until the end of time.  :)  and that's okay,  maybe it's a good thing.    Corporations care about limiting liability and public image.   

Look at the CNN leaked tape of Amy robach on a hot mic explaining how she had an Estein story for 3 years, with victim testimony.   It got squashed because they feared upsetting people in power.  and CNN put out an update that they would be looking for the person who leaked that tape , to fire them. 

that's not the right thing, but it limits their liability. 

my definition of racism is hating an other ethnic group, or believing they are inferior / you are superior.  

outside of that, you're not racist.   you may do something that is racially or culturally insensitive, and at times they look the same,  but its not. 

I know there's been a push on some colleges to say that racism is anything that makes a minority feel uncomfortable.   Did i hold open a door for someone 10 seconds behind me?  but not the person 60 seconds behind me?     oh that 2nd person was a different ethnicity than me, RACISM!!!   but no.   or  prejudice + power = racism.      even if i have no power, i'm a racist under that theory because i'm white and i prejudge blacks as not getting a sun burn as quickly as me.   

shrugs  I don't care that the correct nuanced view is so difficult for people to grasp that they don't get it.  its still the correct answer. 

and yes with out any other info, i would guess he was racist,  but that's a GUESS.    charolettes ville march was racist, because they were exposing views of that they felt they were superior to others. 

But say lots of Dave Chapelle's stand up  is racially insensitive, but not racist, because he's joking. 

if you think the OP's class clown was racist, reguardless of what is in his heart, then you also have to think dave chappelle is racist , or you are a hypocrite.   which is fine, people come in all sorts of flavors._____ -   he's trying to ask ""what's your ethnicity"" but doesn't know the proper wording.     Or maybe he thinks he's being funny. 

  

\shrugs\ my mom does a lot of work for charity, and gives a lot of money to charities.   all sorts of charities for peoples of all many different countries.    but she will say the term wet back.    esp with the amount of hispanic friends i have its so cringe.    she's not hateful, she doesn't feel any other ethnicity is inferior or any of that hot garbage.  but she still says that...   

  

some non hateful people literally get stuck in their ways.   if you know them, and know they aren't actually racist, (but maybe do some things that are racially insensitive)    cut them some slack, while continually reminding them of the correct way. 

  

So in your case,   treat him like a toddler and rephrase his question.   or answer as worded, then rephrase?

""what are you?""

""a bit tired, but hopeful,  are you trying to ask my ethnicity?  I'm half Peruvian and half Ecuadorian""   like my little kids, he should pick it up sooner or later._____ -      While those Apples are tainted fruit from the tree of a racist,  the only thing that can purify the unfortunate apples is to pass through the holy fire of a non racists digestive track.     not all of us can be that hero, but thankfully you are there for us.

According to Church teachings sexual orientation itself is not a sin, as the person can't choose it, but the person can choose their actions, i.e. whether or not to have sex with another man/woman. There are individual priests, (and to some extent the pope) who make it sound more like double-speak by being vague about the sin part in an attempt to attract as many members as possible, but the actual Church teachings are clear.

 Two years ago my in laws went travelling and picked up this bottle of wine. They sent me a picture of it and said they'd picked me up something special.

To me, it sounds like a miscommunication at this point. You thought they meant it was a gift for you, they thought they were buying something to share with everyone--but that they'd chosen because they knew you loved it.
 as I went to put it in my bag my Mother in l law whimpered and said it was intended for all of us to drink together.

So she cleared up the miscommunication/misunderstanding then.

test	telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a SAHM I am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore	"I have a cleaning company, some of our clients are ""don't lift a finger"" excutives. it takes 9 hours a week (not including cooking and shopping) for laundry, tidying and cleaning up after 1.5 adults (think occasional GF overnight/friend came in for a shower after golf to change to go to show) 3000sq  2.5 bath home that virtually zero cooking is done in.  And that's someone who is not watching kids at the same time.  But yeah those houses are really clean.  

With toddlers its way more laundry and way way more picking up.  think 2 hours a day 7 days a week plus 5 hours a week for the bigger stuff you only do once a week plus 5 hours a month for the really big stuff.  And that doesn't count cooking and is if you were not caring for 2 childeren while doing it. _____NAH but I still think you're wrong.  

2 context points..

if the plan is realistically she stays home till the kids are in full-time school and past the age of room moms. She will be working every waking hour for 7 years then go back to full-time work + half the chores.  I'm bringing this up because pre-70s when a housewife was much more common those SAHMs got to stay home the whole time. So while mom may had had 5 rough years (until they could say watch your brother while I have a shower/go play outside) they also got 45 more years of not working outside of the home at least not as a breadwinner under financial pressure.  BTW lots of those upper middle case SAHM of the 50s and 60s had housekeepers too. 

point 2 

Those moms had more SAHMs to network with, their neighbors, sisters, others, and aunts stayed at home moms too.    Oh and Dad's were still expected to help with homework, take the kids for ice cream or teach them to fish or ride a bike and discipline. and don't forget about home repairs and lawn care, banking, he might have even done the grocery shopping cause he was the one who drove etc. and take mom out for date night and BBQ and probably an inside chore or 2 like drying the dishes or have a vegetable garden.  I'm saying you can't just cherry pick one aspect of that lifestyle and call it good.     So you're ""I work that will be my only contribution"" is a ""never was"" fantasy.   

So I don't think you're an asshole but I do think you're wrong, yeah she should do more around the house but it never should be ""you do everything.""

The context that is virtually impossible to gauge without knowing you does matter a lot. If you have been saying ""Were exclusive but casually dating"" VS  planning vague shit years down the line, ""We should go to Paris one day maybe after we graduate and have been working a few years"" 

There is a huge difference between:

I like you and have no clue whether I'd want to marry you at some point in the future. 

I really love them but there is an issue I hope they fix that so we can get married. 

I have no intention of marrying anyone and am clear about that.

I want to get married someday and I am 95%+ sure I don't want to marry you specifically.  But they are fun for now, when we graduate/when I met someone better I'll break up with her. 

The asshole comes from the not being clear she failed ""the interview"" that she reasonably thinks is still a mutual interview.  This is gender biased but in my personal observation men are much more likely than women to continue dating after they firmly decide ""She is definitely not for me"" That included first date ""eww I hate this chick but she seems willing to sleep with me, I'll sleep with her and just not call her back""  because of that women incorrectly conclude ""we're still dating = this relationship is progressing"" _____ but don't tell her off because it won't be effective and it may even encourage her to be more toxic.  People have the idea that toxic are master manipulators and think that means they plan everything; In my experience, they don't plan anything its more they have unconsciously leanred ""it feels good to make up after a fight""  so when they feel bad they start a fight, they don't know why they are starting a fight.  The behavior it instinct and emotion-based and geared for instant gratification and remember that gratification will very likely not be at all healthy.  It's frequently things like ""they're very upset AHHHH they still love me/I still control them/I'm better then them/Now they will talk to me (even if it's yelling, yelling is more gratifying then silence), etc.  so sending an email/letter is ""the fix"" they are seeking by acting inapporpiatly don't comply._____So you are a human rapist detector more so then your GF who I can almost guarantee you has been practicing this her whole adult life. 

And just as a postscript if I was assaulted and my BF wanted to met male coworkers to protect me because BF thought they might pick up on body language I missed...I might hear ""it was your fault you were assaulted because you miss body language."" I might wonder if you doubted me I might think you have no fucking clue.  _____ you escalated way too far.  She was may have asked your parents, but they are the ones who agreed to not to loan you the money for her sake ($3500 ish US if I did the conversion right) 

In a gossipy group, people would have forgotten ""borrowed money"" real fast and are smart enough to figure out you're doing OK on their own eventually.  BUT people don't forget a major moral taboo. And if I understand the culture you also did major social damage to your parents and other siblings oh and yourself.  

You brought a nuke to a slap fight. People love juicy gossip but the smart ones will never trust you. _____And I mean the accusation wasn't that clear , ""I have gut feeling"", ""I am uncomfortable about your relationship with your soon to be SIL"" might mean I think you're sleeping together or you obviuosly have undisclosed feeling towards her (and come on we have all seen someone in love with their friends or relatives wife/GF), you're rude to her, or you treat her with way more respect then you give me, you're nicer to her, etc.  I mean from the way it reads ""Mt gf just broke up with me because of our relationship"" what haha she's just jealous my GF is prettier and more successful"" and  ""yeah she is banned from my life""  OP and her fiancee sound super supportive. 

For example, I had a friend with a GF who was just mean as honey badger but he had a sarcastic bitty sense of humor, so he took a lot of the really mean things she said as jokes.  ""yeah I suck for buying you flowers and not letting the plant just live their lives in the park haha""  once he saw he interacting with people she respected more it was ""oh shit you mean all that stupid mean BS, fuck you I'm out""_____Because maybe she didn't fire OP for exposing her child to a psycho killer/child molester but because OP decided to invite her BF to hang out while she was babysitting. 

And she jumped to ""Did you invite him"" cause that's a very very VERY common issue with babysitters, haven't you ever seen a horror movie (in that case the troupe is based on the reality that babysitters someone invite their BF/GF friends over when there are no adults O)"	care:1,fairness:1,sanctity:3,authority:1,loyalty:1_____care:3,authority:3_____care:3,authority:1,sanctity:1_____care:3,fairness:1,loyalty:1_____care:1,authority:2,loyalty:2_____care:3,loyalty:1,sanctity:1	1_____1_____0_____1_____1

&gt;I told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. 

Really? I thought the purpose was for her to be home with your children, not to become your full time maid. 

And if you deserve a break after being at work for so many hours - knowing that she is at home watching the kids the entire time you're at work - when does she get her break? She's expected to just be on duty 24/7 with no help from you because you work outside the home?

 I drag my ass out of it and tell my self to stop being a bitch. The world doesn't owe you anything and it could be a lot worse.

Friendship is a two-way street, you deserve the same support you give your friends. And it doesn't sound like they refuse to give it, but like you refuse to open up about needing it. 

Even ""the strong one"" needs someone to lean on from time to time, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it and it doesn't make you a bitch or a pussy or any of those mean things you say to yourself. Being vulnerable is fucking HARD, it takes guts, especially if you're the type who tends to keep things to yourself. 

I get what you're saying about not wanting to drown in self pity, and it's good to keep things in perspective and know it could be worse - but just because it could be worse, or because someone else has it worse, that doesn't negate your right to feel sad/upset/whatever the fuck you want about your own situation. 

_____ - if one of my friends made a pass at my SO and they didn't tell me, I'd be really pissed. Mostly at the friend, obviously, but also at my SO for hiding this type of betrayal from me. Anyone who would try to hit on my SO behind my back is clearly not a real friend, and I feel like I have a right to know that. 

I would be very hurt to find out that not only has my friend betrayed me, but the person I'm in a relationship with than kept it from me so I ""wouldn't get upset"". Yeah better to have a shit friend who's hitting on your SO than get upset.../s_____ - except Dave. They suck for talking shit about your friend. And you suck for making sure he heard about it. How did he benefit from that knowledge? 

“It takes your enemy and your friend, working together, to hurt you to the heart: the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you.”_____Ask for help when you need it. ""For no one can fill those of your needs that you won't let show."" -Lean On Me

If you're choosing to ""muddle through"" and refusing to ask for help, how are your friends supposed to know it? In their eyes, this is the first time you've needed help that they couldn't be there for, so they've done nothing wrong. 

Don't go the opposite way now and ask that they meet your EVERY need, definitely be as self-sufficient as possible. But I'm sure your friends wouldn't mind helping you out more if you give them more than a day's notice. 

Grocery pickup is a thing most places, you can ask a friend what day they'd be available to give you a ride and then schedule your grocery pickup for that day. (I know your post was about the pharmacy but in a comment you mentioned eating bread for days rather than asking for help). Having a pickup order ready would make it a lot easier to get a ride, because then it's just to pickup the groceries and you're not expecting anyone to wait while you shop._____If she's not comfortable with you hanging out with this friend, you asking her to join you is a fair compromise. Her refusing to even give that a chance is really unfair.

Follow up question - when you offer to hang out with this other friend and your gf, are you talking just the three of you, or part of a larger group? If it's the former, I guess I could kinda understand your gf not wanting to feel like a third wheel to you and your friend (which can definitely happen without you intending it).

We don't intentionally shame those we love, but we also don't sit idly while they kill themselves.  If an obese person wants to get help and lose weight, it can be immensely helpful for a significant other to help keep track if the obese person isn't able to identify the problem foods.  Secret eating and high calorie foods are two big offenders in staying obese when people are seeking help.  There's a difference between counting drinks and keeping a detailed log of food.

In reference to your other comment, alcoholism is not a medical diagnosis.  Alcohol Use Disorder is a medical diagnosis.  Given his heavy alcohol use, quitting cold turkey could do serious damage or even kill him.  Congrats on your recovery, but please be aware that alcohol use disorder is a medical diagnosis.

She sucks for not taking care of herself, you suck for badgering her instead of sitting her down, telling you that you love her, and the first step to getting help is to go to the doctor.  If you really want to support her, ask her if she wants help setting up an appointment.  Does she want someone to go with her?  What if she had a daughter who grew up to have these same pains and irregularity?  She could spare her theoretical child by getting help and knowing what to address with professionals._____.  Denying food to your child is a great way to teach her an unhealthy relationship with food, cloud her mind because she's too hungry, or teach her to sneak and stash food because you're overbearing.  You could and should use this opportunity to work out healthy snacks and give her some autonomy.  Adults get breaks during work in which they can eat.

""I make my kid go hungry and refuse to give her a break after school because I'm controlling about her homework.  It doesn't matter if it's completed or if she's hungry, it matters that I have control.""   That's you.  That's what you sound like._____ if you don't take care of your child.  She's suffering from a phobia and you don't want her to get help.  That makes you a bad parent. 

It won't make her limit her contact with people who use substances and it's unrealistic to think that she'll never have a drink.  You really want her to be unable to grab a cocktail with her friends when she's legally able to drink?  Actually be a parent and teach her about substance safety.  Abstinence education doesn't work.  What happens if she gets the flu?  How will she take care of herself if she's living in a dorm?_____.  She's a kid.  She's irresponsible but not an asshole.  She wanted to do something on her own, failed, and came to you.  Your daughter could have practiced the recipe before trying to film it.  She could have asked your mother to let her have the kitchen because it's school related.  You could have spoken to your mother if your mother refused to respect your daughter's request.

The sleepover should be canceled because she hasn't cleaned her room.  Not knowing how to organize things can be really tough on kids.  It's easy to shove things under beds and into closets so it's visually clean, but learning to organize in small areas is the best way to manage it.

If she has consistent trouble with time management and organization, consider taking her to be evaluated for ADHD.  The inability to manage time and get things done properly can be indicative of an underlying problem rather than teen laziness and defiance._____. In Judaism, one is welcome to practice if they truly believe in it. There is Jewish law governing who is Jewish by birth, but the right thing to do here would've been to research how to become Jewish by Jewish law. 

Conversion requires a few things: the convert must be sincere, doing it of their own free will, converting for the right reasons, have a knowledge of the faith and how it's practiced, and they must agree to live a Jewish life.  It sounds like she'd be well qualified for Jewish court conversion and her rabbi will be a great source for making it legally so.

Tell her a Jewish lady on the internet welcomes her as one of us.

When someone cheats, two things need to happen. 

The cheater needs to be ruthlessly patient with the barrage of questions (""why are you getting home so late"" etc) that will be present for quite some time. 

The person who got cheated on eventually has to learn to not obsess over where that person is every second of the day and make their life a living hell for the rest of eternity. A good starting point for this is the attitude that if they cheat on you again, so what. Not that you should bury your head in the sand in denial. What I'm saying is that if someone cheats on you, it's THEIR problem. It only becomes your problem if you get angry about it. The anger allows their transgression to get inside your head and go around and around and around. If there is no anger, that process doesn't happen.

So, if you don't trust him yet, you don't trust him. That process CANNOT be rushed or accelerated. The only thing that will fix it is time, and a lot of it. 

With all that being said, I think certain scenarios call for a shot a reconciliation. Those would be along the lines of a one time thing while out drinking one night (the drinking does not excuse it), or cheating after you've been married for quite some time and have kids, etc. 

I've always said that if my SO cheated before marriage, that would be the end of it.  _____ We have no idea whether or not she didn't care.

We know she didn't care because she lied. If you know someone is saving themselves for marriage and wants the same in a partner, and you yourself aren't saving yourself for marriage, but lie and say that you are, you don't care about them. 

 Even if virginity is important, can you fathom wanting to leave your spouse, the person you love and have given your heart to, simply because she wasn't actually a virgin when you met?

I certainly can. If I were a virgin who was only looking for another virgin, I found one, married them, had sex with them, and later found out they weren't who they said they were, that would be a betrayal of epic proportions. That can't be undone or fixed. In that case, ""the person I loved and gave my heart to"" didn't exist. 

 Okay, I should have read your whole comment before replying. Apparently you just have a very fucked up view of relationships.

I probably didn't do a good job of explaining that. What I'm saying is that if this guy goes back on his beliefs and says, ""man, that was really stupid, I shouldn't have made my virginity such a big deal"", the next logical thing he's going to say to himself is, ""shit, if it wasn't a big deal, I wish I had gotten to experience a lot more people before I got married."" But now that's not an option. He's stuck. _____. 

This is a good lesson on why you should wait to have sex, for an extended period of time at least. I get ridiculed for saying that because people think I'm talking about old fashioned, puritanical, religious reasons, but that's not it. 

This was a pre-planned scheme. This woman is used to taking advantage of men for their money. She got found out by her husband, got booted out, and used her guile to grab a sucker (sorry) to get out of her financial predicament. That's all you ever were, and that's why she slept with you early; to hook you. Now you're an addict, she owns you, and can get you to do anything she wants. Had you not had sex with her, she would have no power over you. 

This has downsides for women as well. Go over to r/relationshipadvice and you won't have to look hard to find posts where women are complaining that their long term BF isn't making any moves towards marriage. That's the old ""don't buy the cow if the milk is free"" scenario. 

I wouldn't have sex with someone without waiting months and months and months getting to know them. That way if I find something like this, it's easier to extricate myself from the situation. Once you have sex, it's exponentially harder to get out. 

You can see that in your post...you found out she was a high priced call girl (and married), but chose to ignore it because you thought she loved you. She didn't. She was just using you, and I guarantee she had nothing but contempt for you. 

The real reason you chose to ignore it was because she was beautiful and a freak in bed, and the pleasure you got from her superseded all common sense and reason.

I dunno about getting revenge. If she had drained your bank accounts and bailed, yes. I would just take this as a lesson and move on. 

Last thing - drop the hate. The hate only hurts you. It doesn't affect her one bit. As long as you hate her, you will be mentally glued to her. Once you are able to drop the hate, you'll be able to move on. 

  _____He was a virgin and wanted to marry one. He said that in his post. You clearly disagree but that really doesn’t matter. Just because it’s old fashioned or isn’t what you would do doesn’t amount to shit. All of this falls under sexual preferences and it doesn’t matter if it’s fair or rational or popular. 

What matters is that she knew his dealbreakers and intentionally and repeatedly lied. I don’t give a shit how great of a person you are or what kind of times we’ve had together, if you tricked me into a relationship with you, you can get the fuck out. _____. I’ll get downvoted for this but I don’t give a shit. 

This idea we have nowadays that you can go out and screw as many people as you want and no one can judge you for it is a load of horseshit. You can do what you want, I completely support that idea, but when it comes to deciding who I will sleep with and more importantly who I will spend the rest of my life with, I get to do what the hell I want.

She lied to you. If you had slept with a bunch of girls, married your wife thinking she was a virgin, and found this out, you would be a hypocrite and an asshole. 

You yourself were a virgin, and you thought that’s what you were getting. She lied, tricked you, and ruined what you were saving for that one special person. 

I would be furious as well and if I were in your shoes this would be a dealbreaker for me. 

Full disclosure - I wasn’t a virgin when I got married, and I didn’t marry a virgin. I didn’t intend to save myself. I’m putting that out there to let you know that I’m not agreeing because we have the same philosophy. I’m agreeing because she knew your desires/intentions and she lied. That’s bullshit. People are going to call you old fashioned, tell you that you can’t judge her, etc. Again, that’s horseshit. She lied. _____. I'm going to short sell some of my karma with my opinion on this. You're never TA for snooping. All is fair in love and war.

There have been posts here and on other subreddits where people have snooped, found that their SO was cheating, and they still got shit from other posters for snooping. That's bat shit crazy.

Marriage nowadays is the equivalent of taking your children, half of everything you have ever worked for, and a significant chunk of your future income, and putting it on black at the roulette table in Vegas. If you hit red, you lose. If you hit black, you don't lose, but you don't win anything either.

That's why I live by ""all is fair in love and war."" With all that riding on a relationship, you'd be an idiot not to gather intelligence and build defenses. If you can catch these problems (someone trying to move in on your SO) when they are small, then the problems stay small. If you bury your head in the sand because you are afraid to snoop, small problems become bigger and more horrendous than you can ever imagine.

  

Edits -

1) Compulsive snooping is different and not what I'm referring to. That's a separate issue which needs it's own explanation. 

2) Lots of other posters have mentioned trust. Have you yourself always been perfect? Have you made any mistakes or done anything shitty to another person? Odd are very good that you have. So if you can't trust yourself to be perfect 100% of the time, how can you then expect (trust) someone else 100% of the time? People are going to make mistakes. If you think you can blindly trust someone 100% of the time and for the rest of your life, I have a bridge to sell you. 

Life isn't about perfection. It's about dealing with imperfect people perfectly.

Just feels like im going to make HR look bad now.. 

Oh, you are. But I completely feel you on your reasons for wanting to quit. Sometimes you have to do what's best for you, even if that means being the asshole._____ - not all employers celebrate birthdays. Mine does a group celebration at the end of each month where they buy us a cake and acknowledge whoever's birthday was in the last month. But most employers I've had did nothing at all. 

 One of my colleagues (who I hadn’t yet informed that it was my birthday) suggested that we head over to the new Italian place for lunch 

So someone who didn't even know it was your birthday suggested lunch, why on earth would you assume anyone is going to pay for you just because it's your birthday? Unless someone offers, I don't know why you would expect it. No one owes you lunch just cuz it's your birthday.

 I was so upset I put down cash to cover around half of my order, the money we pooled together obviously came up short and people were very confused, one of the senior staff ended up paying the difference and I said nothing obviously.

That makes you an even bigger asshole, causing an issue and forcing someone else to pay half your meal. Shame on you._____ but only because you say that sharing the till is common practice. When I was a cashier, you NEVER shared your till, for this very reason. So we know who is to blame when money is missing. But I've never worked fast food to know if that's just the way it is..._____So there won't be any traditional Thanksgiving foods at all? Just tamales? Man, I'd be kinda pissed, and I come from a large, (mostly) Mexican family. So we have tamales at just about every family gathering. But we still have the traditional spread for Thanksgiving and I look forward to it! 

If I misunderstood and its tamales in addition, then I'd suck it up and pay $10 even if I didn't plan on eating any tamales. But I don't think I'd be down to pay for someone to just entirely fuck up my Thanksgiving dinner...

It can offend people. People who are just outgoing enough to start conversations with strangers to be told they behave as though they have a disability, or its reasonable to assume that they may can easily be offended by careless words. People with autism can be offended by saying a person who would show a stranger porn acts like they have autism. You just don't know,  uoi never want to jump to the conclusion someone is disabled. It's being socially aware of your words and how they affect others.
Logic again. Sexual harassment doesn't need intent for malice. A guy refusing to accept a no and continuing to ask a girl out can be harassment. A guy cat calling a girl because he's known girls who like it can be harassment. Sexual harassment doesn't need malice, just ignorance of appropriateness. If your coworker showed you porn, he'd be fired. At school, suspended or warned. In public, removed. Possibly banned. Just because he has no social skills doesn't mean it's ok. Many who are approached feel trapped. They feel uncomfortable but they don't want to be rude or confrontational. The situation makes them uncomfortable. They might be afraid.  In no way is showing someone you don't know porn or hentai ok.
I have wasted way too much time on this because  it's essentially as basic as choosing your words carefully and recognizing that real threats don't always have to have malicious intent. I could suggest someone who easily labels people with disorders might have some sort of mental disorder themselves, but that would be a 20 foot leap, not very nice, not at all founded, and potentially hurtful.

If a casual friend hurt my close friend or family, and I went as far as openly admitting they treated someone I care about like shit and disrespected them, I wouldn't want to have them in my life.

People will freak out and accuse you of being controlling, but honestly, ex treated you badly, brother was on your side, then brother wasn't. It wasn't like they were ever close._____
What. The. Actual fuck.
He has no right to put you on speaker phone without telling you. Especially when discussing a delicate topic. Speak up. Tell him that you are uncomfortable discussing private things on speaker phone. Why haven't you said anything? This is beyond unacceptable. If he refuses, stop calling him.

He found it funny to watch his friends harass you over having a difference of opinion. That's what this is about. He says his friends harassing you needs to be respected as an opinion. He is trash and all of you need to unfriend and block._____

I'm assuming by ""friends"", she means randos following her online. If she's done with that life,  she can easily remove the randos who paid her for nudes. Which in this day and age of internet...
Why keep her old ""fans""? They should be nothing to her.

Now if these are actual friends she knows irl, then my skin is crawling. That's not ""friends"". Who does that??

However. You lied to her about how you felt to not be ""uncool""? Come on dude. If I was a guy, I'd tell her she was great, but this was a personal dealbreaker. I wouldn't pretend it's ok all the while being upset. If you were willing to start a committed relationship and marry her, you couldn't be that bothered about her morals or the nudes. It's more like you just are upset randos saw her naked, and now they follow her life online. Having her block them from following her won't change what she did, but it will remove those guys from her life. Which won't make you stop feeling embarrassed about what she did, but will I guess, stop them from having a ""connection"" with her.

She sucks if she refuses to block a few randos now that she's done selling nudes to them. What does it matter?

 She's not the asshole for being upset you lied for 3 years. Take her as she is, or don't. That was your choice._____I can see how you might feel it's suppression in non harassment cases, but there are other ways to look at it beyond your own view. The blanket statement was about blocking being cowardly  insinuated that it was already cowardly. When, as you agree, it can be necessary. Even in social media, sometimes a,stranger who disagrees will stalk you. People can be crazy. 

When someone is this bad of a friend, that they avoid you when you write them a super polite doormat style text, unfriending them is the way to go. They are not your friend. Blocking them can just be a more final and therapeutic for some. Out of sight, out of mind. No anger or spite necessarily, just getting them out of your life, and a symbolic way to do that permanently helps some people.  She already contacted her, beyond what she obviously saw at dinner when the two couples panicked.  She doesn't care. There is no problem to fix other than removing her from her life. I'd probably just unfriend, but some people need to block to remove them from their vision, or the symbolism gives them closure. shrug"	care:3,sanctity:2,authority:2_____authority:2,loyalty:2,care:2_____loyalty:3,authority:1,sanctity:1_____sanctity:1,care:3,authority:1_____sanctity:1,authority:2,fairness:1_____care:3,authority:1	1_____0_____1_____1_____1

Your disagreement with my judgment doesn't mean I can't read or process what you wrote.  I don't really care if you downvote me, I'm not a sensitive kid on the internet.

A place that serves food shouldn't have to inform you that you aren't welcome to eat your outside food there.  It's a common sense policy, you don't need to have your hand held to know that.  What restaurant allows you to bring your own food when they serve their own food?  They were nice enough not to ask you to leave the first time, but that's still not the same as them telling you that you can eat your outside food there.  Reasons to bring your own food to a restaurant include a severe allergy that can't risk cross-contamination (while your companion still purchases a meal from their menu), bringing something to eat for a small child, or walking back into the place to eat food that you had initially bought to go.  It's a private business, not a place for you to advertise something they don't serve and don't profit from.  You don't have to go there if it doesn't work for you, but  for ignoring a common sense policy of which they shouldn't need to inform you.  

I wasn't harsh on your wife, her spills are completely her own fault.  Yeah, she spilled, but what does that have to do with the coffee shop?  You can't blame any of that on the business, the coffee is her responsibility when it's in her hands._____First off, congrats on the new baby!!

.  Their existence as a customer doesn't mean that you're a slave.  If you weren't taking custom orders, why would they think you'd accepted their order?  If their account is terminated, I can imagine it'll protect other sellers from being harassed._____This is basically how it works when a cash tab is reopened, yes.  A reopened tab doesn't list anything about the payment unless there's a card authorization.  The ""cash due"" line on the bartender printout will list a number $20 less than it should be from that closed out tab so there will essentially be an extra $20 in the drawer.

Managers can often get away with voiding a $20 bill as waste consumption in the event of a walkout, but $50 is too much to get away with.  The fact that the manager left early instead of counting out the drawer to find the discrepancy makes me think it's more theft than favoritism._____.  You were honest about being in CAP, not enlisted.  You didn't ask for the discount, it was offered.  If a fast food discount that you didn't ask for is stolen valor, steal all of that tasty, tasty valor._____It's not rude at all to let the board know that you're struggling to access the courses because of the program itself.  It's the truth and they ought to know.  Your school may actually have more leverage with the company for a faster fix or even be released from an unfulfilled contract if they have proof of inaccessibility.  This can also help to protect you in case you get a 0 on an assignment you can't submit through no fault of your own._____, but I think you need to have a different conversation. When's the last time you had a raise? If you've been somewhere for 10 years where you consistently need to do 10-15 hours of overtime both to live and because your restaurant needs a manager on duty, you're understaffed and your pay rate should be renegotiated.

After 10 years of loyalty, you either need to move to another company that will pay you enough to live comfortably on a 40-45 hour schedule (I know restaurant needs vary, 11 years industry myself).

  also ""gender equality"" neither gender gets an automatic claim to keeping the house. 

  

I totally get the pain of losing 1/2 of the proceeds that come from the fruit of your labor.   (I just got divorced, very very Similar situation)   

in most states everything you earn and or buy while married is community property.   So the house is 1/2 your wife's.   you need to divide up all the assets that were acquired during your marriage 50/50 

  

for example so if you have 30K of equity in your house  a car worth 20k and 10k in cash , then you could keep the house and give her the car and 5k . 

  

What you should do is try to work it out with her to divide all the assets equally and get an uncontested divorce. 

Or you'll end up in court, both with expensive lawyers and you'll get 50% of what they lawyers didn't take. 

  when your wife is willing to talk, talk to her, if she gets really angry and argue tell her you will continue later but are done for the day.   I did this with my ex and we eventually figured out an equal division of all of the assets we acquired while married and sharing the kids 50/50 . 

  

  

  _____Being able to afford something doesn't mean go for it.  I can afford to total one of my cars and get a  reckless driving ticket.    I don't think the rational of ""i can afford it""  = go for it. 

many countries  could afford to send nuclear waste into space ..   but its a bad idea cause if the rocket has a mishap we will would basically be setting off a dirty bomb in the atmosphere . 

  

either something is a good idea , on its own merits,  or it isn't.   

  

And there's lots people \Should\ do.   pick up our own trash ,  don't waste water, food, power.  be nice to each other,  avoid murdering people.  

  

some of these things society feels so strongly about we write laws (no murder)   and some of them just get PSA's and each person is given the choice to do what they want. 

  

I'm not saying take away choices.   i'm not saying we as a society should FORCE people to adopt.  I'm saying its my view, i feel strongly enough about to ...    ask people to consider it.  :) 

  

   I agree its easier to raise kids you have a biological attachment to, then kids where you have zero.     Surrogacy/IVF  is a very very logical idea for those who can't conceive naturally.   makes sense.    but yet , i'll still ask. 

  

\shrugs\ it makes sense that some people litter , its easier and more convenient for them. (maybe they can afford the ticket?)   if you are old with no kids or family you won't even be around to see the damages, but i'll still ask those people to stop littering. :)  _____ -  Though not to the extent they are saying. 

Legally Everything acquired after you get married is community property (most states) .    Cash, beanie babies, animals,  credit card points.   so those points are half yours , and are yours to do with what you like. 

  

Yes you should be able to get away from the house, and go where ever you want  when its his turn with the kids.   Though you should be available for facetime / phone calls. 

  

So you only make $500 a month, you're in debt, and don't have enough money to buy more data on your phone plan to face time your kids while you're away and you want to take a vacation ?   Sorry to be the bearer of bad news (reality) but it does not sound like you have your life priorities in order.  

  

I just got divorced myself and I've been the primary care giver to my kids , and i'm also the primary bread winner.     before the divorce i would wake up early  with all the kids, make everyones breakfast, take the kids into daycare , leave work, pick up the kids, and then make dinner,  feed then clean up the kids, make their lunches, clean up the kitchen,  pick out their clothes for the next day.     Rinse and repeat for 5 years .  my Ex didn't even take the kids for 2 months after moving out cause she didn't want to ""wake up early"" 

  

Its exhausting and it feels like ""i deserve a vacation""   i have access to money i could use for one, but the house i just bought really needs new carpeting in the kids room, and the roof needs replacement.     needing/wanting/hard work wise i have earned a vacation.     Looking at my income,assets,debt i have not ""earned"" , as i don't have $1,000 i can spend with out it affecting other areas of my life.  :( 

  

so ya for thinking you deserve a vacation, that a vacation right now is a good idea.  you are kind of an asshole, esp if you can't have facetime access (2 or 3 nights?)  

  

Alimony or no alimony, child support or not.   you should come up with a plan on how you can be self sufficient  you never know, he could end up injured or disabled and his income would dry up.  

  

:( 

  

I am very sorry that life is giving you the short end of the stick.  I hope you have a happy new years and that good things come your way in 2019. _____yta - kinda, a little bit.    its much easier to see a marriage as a joining of everything, when you bring 50k debt to the table.   What if you were bringing 50K cash and he wanted to buy a bunch of star wars props with 25K of it cause ""half mine half yours?""      that said i did assume 100% of my ex-wives debt when we got married and i paid it off.  wouldn't say that was ""fair"" but i loved her at the time.    (it was only 7k though) 

  

 But i think the yours is yours , mine is mine,  is not a good way to create a family out of 2 seperate lives.    didn't work out in my situation 

  

I use mint , you can add in all your bank accounts and each person can see exactly where all the money goes.   you have to do a bit of fine tuning for the categorization early on.   or that $500 TV that was bought at costco shows up as groceries . but its a big help.  _____

  normally posts for ""feeling"" are shit posts , cause you can feel how you want.. but not this time. 

  

How do you know that you are undervalued?  Did you interview at other companies and then get offered a higher wage? 

  

Do yourself a huge favor.  best career advice i've gotten in 22 years.     once a year (can be more often)  apply at enough jobs to get an interview.    see if you A) get offered a job, and B) how much money they offer you. 

  

If you get offered more money, then yes feel undervalued, but don't stop there.  go in and tell your boss ""hey joe, i love it here, love working with you, but i applied for some jobs.  really just to gauge the job market,  turns out i can make X more at acme anvils .   While i love working with you,  i'd be a fool to pass up 20 an hour there, even though i do enjoy working with you joe,  but 18 just won't cut it. "" 

  

9 times out of 10 you'll get a raise.   but you can only pull that at the same company about once every 5 years.   the rest of the time you'll have to switch jobs for that raise. 

  

there's a chance also you won't find any other jobs, or jobs for better pay.  that will help you take a more positive attitude into your current job and not get fired. :) 

  

I've got about 3 months myself and then i'm gonna look for a new job (don't want one) but its a good experience to go through.. yearly ! _____ - helping family doesn't come with conditions.   

  

""oh your finances are bad?  well how much were you investing in X,Y,and Z.  only if i like how you distributed your stocks will i help you. You bought EA stock last year?  go Blank yourself ... ""

He threatened to move out when she called you a whore, but did he ever tell her that what she did is unacceptable?  The price became about him, it wasn't a demand of respect for you.  This is a slippery slope.  You're with a 27+ year old noodle and it sounds like you're living in the same house as his mother?  Is this the life you want?  I already find it concerning enough that a 19 year old was dating a 27 year old and living at home.  He's 27+, this is who he is.  If he can't stand up to his mother to protect his family of choice, you need to think about whether he'd be willing and able to protect any kids in the future.  _____He's still an adult and should pick up at home.  Is he not already helping to clean up at home?  He's going to increase the cleaning burden both by firing the housekeeper and deciding that he's not going to help out.  It's just not fair to shove that all onto someone else because they're staying home to raise children.  He and the kids are benefitting a lot from having her as a SAHM, it isn't all about her.  It would be far more reasonable to keep the housekeeper and maybe hire a week so his wife can have some adult time.

Switching an income job for being a SAHM doesn't mean she no longer has any kind of job or work to do._____Even 10 months is early to move in together.  You're thinking way too far ahead, slow your roll.  You barely know this woman, you've probably had a bottle of shampoo or deodorant longer than you've known her. 

It's very fair that your new girlfriend wouldn't want your ex wife in a shared home, but you currently live alone and are entitled to have guests for dedicated pet visits.  You can always take the cats over to visit her, but you're rushing this relationship with these conversations.  Don't move in with anyone you wouldn't consider marrying someday.

You quit your job without anything lined up.  Your grandparents already have three people living with them.  They could have 50 spare rooms and you still won't be entitled to freeload.

Edit: formatting._____you know this could very easily spin out into a divorce, right? I know this is not an advice sub explicitly. you may want to retain legal counsel now if that's where you want to take this. if you want to stay the course on the marriage then get some kind of intervention (and even then maybe hedge with some legal retainer). 

Consider financial planning or some other way of segregating sole money choices away from either of you. 

_____ - I had a simialr headcount in the US for a wedding 15 years ago at 10k. 

I've got nothing to say about the SO, but getting a nice venue locked down, tableware, food, bar, DJ, formalwear, pictures all add up to a big tab these days.

if I couldn't add insight to how to make something cheaper/better during mine I kept out of it. I was blessed in that my in laws were footing the bill. my point here is that no matter who pays, this gets expensive real fast, that's just a shitty truth.
_____stop creating a double standard for sure. the balance sheet is even on loans and repayments. the relationship is clearly manipulative and has a history of abuse. 

Even if your mother is your pimp and thinks she's entitled to your earnings, it's time to move on. I'm not speculating on OPs profession, but the mom has a clearly stated history of prostitution as a frame of reference.

The couple is free to get married outside the Church. Why should the Church provide them a space for it if they're not even going to raise their children in it?
 ""You can be LGBTQIA+, but most of our priests think it's a sin and our Pope, who literally speaks to God, released a doctrine claiming that all trans people are 'confused.' Totally come to church, though- we love you!!!""

According to Church teachings sexual orientation itself is not a sin, as the person can't choose it, but the person can choose their actions, i.e. whether or not to have sex with another man/woman. There are individual priests, (and to some extent the pope) who make it sound more like double-speak by being vague about the sin part in an attempt to attract as many members as possible, but the actual Church teachings are clear.

 We love divorcees

The Church is very clear about divorce not being real.  Once again, there are some priests who make it sound like double-speak in an attempt to attract as many congregants as possible, but the actual teachings are clear._____In a first world country in a marriage, (I know they're not technically married, but living together with kids is basically the same thing) to someone who obviously makes a lot of money, whlie taking care of all the childcare duties in that partnership, (yeah, fiancee said he'll help with the kids in the future, but that's not the current situation), having previouslly given up her job by mutual agreement in order to care for those kids, she should be able to buy a few things and not merely be grateful for not being homeless and starving._____, but, speaking as a devout Catholic, you're the one I agree with.

If you guys aren't religious, getting married in a church doesn't make sense. Sure, the grandparents might want it, but they probably also want you guys to be actually practicing the religion too._____ except John and the bosses wife

First you help her book that vacation, and you pretend you're someone she can confide in about the affair...you betrayed John so that you could run to him afterwards and pretend you were the one person he could trust. She chose to have the affair, but you were pretty dang happy to help her do it._____As a devout Catholic...

It doesn't even make sense for you to have a Catholic wedding if you don't believe or practice Catholicism. Your fiance's family's expectation ""because you're Latina"" is absurd.

 Two years ago my in laws went travelling and picked up this bottle of wine. They sent me a picture of it and said they'd picked me up something special.

 as I went to put it in my bag my Mother in l law whimpered and said it was intended for all of us to drink together.

BUT i still didn't get that certain social choices would haunt/follow me.     I didn't get how my classmates would continue to pick on me / torment  / etc for even small social faux pas.  

  

Yet in college that stuff just like never happens.  even if some of your HS classmates end up in your college (mine did)  humans reach some sort of social maturity at 18, (give or take) that they just don't before that. 

  

so back to your points.   

  But young people aren't going to magically become more accepting of gender nonconforming peers if they don't have any because adults keep telling them their wishes are inappropriate and best kept secret.  

Do you have any kids?     Mine are 6,4 4 and besides my best efforts,  my kids will still say stuff like ""wow look at that fat lady""  in public.    kids are fricken kids man.  no filter.  .  

  Unless of course the way they are makes you uncomfortable and you can't honestly tell them that there's nothing outrageous about a boy wearing a dress, even if some people might act like it. You either want that change and support it, or you don't want it and should admit that instead of palming it off on what other people will say or do, as if you're on their side. 

I don't know yet.  my girls have played with trucks , pretend cowgirls and cops, and my son has dressed up in a princess dress.    didn't bother me.  but it wasn't in a true sexual identity way yet. 

I've had all sorts of coworkers,  including a bearded cross dressing man who wore dresses.  and the way some people talked about him i do not wish upon my kids.  (and these were adults) 

  

False dichotomy , i neither want  or don't want that change.  i'm indifferent.      Call me selfish but i won't really care unless one of my kids turns out to be that way.  and then i'd fight for my kid.  but not cause i was a true believer in the cause, but because i love my kids.   

  

and i'm someone who votes for gay marriage, bathroom bills, etc.  my favorite news show is racheal madow.   but i'm very indifferent.   

  

Honestly its not everyone's duty to be super progressive/ woke.  people can be indifferent and just watch culture change with out caring (in the best possible way) and not be bad people.   based upon my negative karma off this topic sadly not enough people feel that way.  but hey ... :P   lol who cares?_____Oh i'm not upset.   i disagree  that there's a link between hugs and kisses for grandma , and assault.    

But if you makes you happy to use words like upset, triggered, etc, sure let's go with that :) 

| I'm saying that discussions of consent and boundaries with children should include family members.

Great idea, i personally agree. 

I disagree,  social situations dictate what appropriate manners  are.  
a hand shake for a deal (business or personal life) can at times require physical contact that you may want to engage in, but it will be seen as rude if you refuse to shake my hand if i sell you my car.   or if i buy your car,   i accept your job offer,  etc. 

If you attend a funeral of one of my loved ones, at my invitation, and i ask you for a hug at this funeral.  i would consider it rude if you refused me.   I think most people (general consensus of society)  would agree. 

etc etc. 

So again,  i like where the OP's heart is at.   reducing sexual assaults is a noble goal and should be applauded.     But i don't think this is a meaningful step towards that goal.   I see it as virtue signaling with out any real benefit to society.   

Hey hopefully i'm wrong.   honestly, how cool would it be if just telling our kids, they can say no to hugs, would end any % of sexual assaults._____Questions for you mister/misses OP  :) 

  

While i like where your heart is at.   I wonder if your Kid(s) have to take baths?  what if they didn't want to take a bath for an entire month,  would their bodily autonomy  override you're thinking they need a bath? 

  

Would you allow them to refuse physical contact from their pediatrician?     obviously one is for physical health, and the other is for manners.  

but if the thought process here is that ANY forced contact will have negative affects of  appropriate physical boundaries, then from your child's point of view, why are you going to let the doctor touch them? 

what about baths?  if your child objects to taking a bath does their physical anatomy override you desire for a clean child?   Once a week is probably enough for health, even if your child at times looks and smells dirty.   would you be willing to endure some social embarrassment for the sake of your child having increased bodily autonomy? 

  

Quite honestly, I would force my kids to hug grandma/grandpa if they didn't naturally.  I do force my 6 year old to take a bath at least once a week, and I take them to the pediatrician.   

  

But,  i to want my kids to have  appropriate physical boundaries.   I want them to play nice with other kids.  

though at times some people may touch them with out their consent.  a teacher, police, fire fighter,  security guard my physically block them  walking where they want to. 

a nurse or doctor may have to touch their eyes, ears, nose, mouth, skin. 

a parent may have to do all of the above, remove a splinter, cut their toe nails, comb hair, etc. 

a stranger, or Friend may not do any of those._____ -  I totally get both sides of this.    if you believe your kid is in a situation that has an increased chance of pain (not talking real injury or death)   or discomfort  , Yes they can use an extra eye on them.      My friend has a water feature in his front yard and my toddler has fallen in. 

  

its natural to tell the other parent or a family friend to look out for the little guy ""on the steps, on that log, etc""    and if the other person drops the ball and the kid gets hurt.  its completely natural to be upset at the other parent.  

  

you yelled but you didn't call her names, you didn't threaten violence, just a legit ""what the hell"" reaction. 

You asked your wife to be extra careful, she confirmed,  and then he got hurt.       shame on her. 

you publicly shamed her   shame on you. 

  

both parties are a fault here.     falling down 2 steps isn't gonna kill him or anything,  Nor is yelling at your wife going to ruin your kids development or any of that mumbo jumbo .   its not polite , but there's not a person alive who has never been rude at least once._____that's an asshole move for sure,  though given the context.  

if i punch someone i'm an asshole,  but if that guy assaulted an elderly woman and stole her purse, that same act makes me a hero. 

Its still terrible behavior, and he should not treat his child that way.    he needs therapy.   but for me (i'm a parent of 3)  i don't think it makes him an asshole ,  he did tell her not to go in there, and she went in with out permission and messed with his shrine to his lost child.       No he absolutely should not be cussing at his child or saying he wished she was the one he lost in the accident.      doesn't Excuse that behavior, but i can understand it, and my heart can go out to both of them.   

like when my 4 year old pees his bed and wakes up upset , screaming and crying.     should i call him an asshole  since it was him who peed?  or should i understand that in that moment he's just lashing out?  

but if that's too nuanced for you.    yes  just tease me because you don't agree with my opinion :)  its fine_____I really like where the OP's heart is at.   and all the  voters.  

However, if i take my 4 year olds into the doctors office they won't have bodily autonomy.     Pediatricians feel their lower abdomen, look in their eyes, ears, mouth ,listen to their heart. etc.   and sometimes they get shots. 

my 4 year olds probably wouldn't consent to a shot.  but they were forced to.      

also if my 4 year old wanders too close to something dangerous i might pick him up.   steep edge of a hiking trail,  stove with a hot cast iron pan, random dog,  traffic.  

So really their doctor, urgent care, nurses, parents, police and fire fighters all might over-ride my child's choice to not be touched.  

due to that list,  I just don't see harm in throwing in grandma / grandpa. 

Though, Honestly, I still really like the idea of teaching consent (toys, rough play, hugs, food, etc)  to very young kids.    I just think this approach is a bit too heavy handed, for what is a fairly nuanced topic."	care:11,authority:5,sanctity:4,fairness:1_____loyalty:1,sanctity:2,authority:4,care:6_____care:5,authority:3,sanctity:2_____authority:1,loyalty:2,care:7_____care:4,sanctity:1,fairness:1,authority:2_____care:6,sanctity:1,authority:1	1_____1_____0_____0_____0

It can offend people. People who are just outgoing enough to start conversations with strangers to be told they behave as though they have a disability, or its reasonable to assume that they may can easily be offended by careless words. People with autism can be offended by saying a person who would show a stranger porn acts like they have autism. You just don't know,  uoi never want to jump to the conclusion someone is disabled. It's being socially aware of your words and how they affect others.
Logic again. Sexual harassment doesn't need intent for malice. A guy refusing to accept a no and continuing to ask a girl out can be harassment. A guy cat calling a girl because he's known girls who like it can be harassment. Sexual harassment doesn't need malice, just ignorance of appropriateness. If your coworker showed you porn, he'd be fired. At school, suspended or warned. In public, removed. Possibly banned. Just because he has no social skills doesn't mean it's ok. Many who are approached feel trapped. They feel uncomfortable but they don't want to be rude or confrontational. The situation makes them uncomfortable. They might be afraid.  In no way is showing someone you don't know porn or hentai ok.
I have wasted way too much time on this because  it's essentially as basic as choosing your words carefully and recognizing that real threats don't always have to have malicious intent. I could suggest someone who easily labels people with disorders might have some sort of mental disorder themselves, but that would be a 20 foot leap, not very nice, not at all founded, and potentially hurtful. If my point wasn't reached at this point, there's no use._____. 
If a casual friend hurt my close friend or family, and I went as far as openly admitting they treated someone I care about like shit and disrespected them, I wouldn't want to have them in my life.

You say they aren't and weren't  even close friends, and he listened to you cry and said he treated you badly.  It would be one thing if he stayed out of it. But he didn't.  It would be one thing if ex hadn't treated you poorly. But he did. It's about loyalty.
People will freak out and accuse you of being controlling, but honestly, ex treated you badly, brother was on your side, then brother wasn't. It wasn't like they were ever close._____
What. The. Actual fuck.
He has no right to put you on speaker phone without telling you. Especially when discussing a delicate topic. Speak up. Tell him that you are uncomfortable discussing private things on speaker phone. Why haven't you said anything? This is beyond unacceptable. If he refuses, stop calling him. 

Him being married doesn't mean you have lost all privacy and she must be privvy to the personal lives of his friends and every conversation he has. Your other friend is insane.
As for the events, get together with the group and make it clear that no one can invite friends or significant others. Spell it out. ""Please do not bring siblings, friends, other family, or partners/spouses."" Send a note. If he cannot oblige, do not invite him.

I don't care what the meme was about, I don't care who thinks what or why.
He found it funny to watch his friends harass you over having a difference of opinion. That's what this is about. He says his friends harassing you needs to be respected as an opinion. He is trash and all of you need to unfriend and block._____

I'm assuming by ""friends"", she means randos following her online. If she's done with that life,  she can easily remove the randos who paid her for nudes. Which in this day and age of internet...
Why keep her old ""fans""? They should be nothing to her.

Now if these are actual friends she knows irl, then my skin is crawling. That's not ""friends"". Who does that??

However. You lied to her about how you felt to not be ""uncool""? Come on dude. If I was a guy, I'd tell her she was great, but this was a personal dealbreaker. I wouldn't pretend it's ok all the while being upset. If you were willing to start a committed relationship and marry her, you couldn't be that bothered about her morals or the nudes. It's more like you just are upset randos saw her naked, and now they follow her life online. Having her block them from following her won't change what she did, but it will remove those guys from her life. Which won't make you stop feeling embarrassed about what she did, but will I guess, stop them from having a ""connection"" with her.

She sucks if she refuses to block a few randos now that she's done selling nudes to them. What does it matter?

 She's not the asshole for being upset you lied for 3 years. Take her as she is, or don't. That was your choice._____I can see how you might feel it's suppression in non harassment cases, but there are other ways to look at it beyond your own view. The blanket statement was about blocking being cowardly  insinuated that it was already cowardly. When, as you agree, it can be necessary. Even in social media, sometimes a,stranger who disagrees will stalk you. People can be crazy. 

When someone is this bad of a friend, that they avoid you when you write them a super polite doormat style text, unfriending them is the way to go. They are not your friend. Blocking them can just be a more final and therapeutic for some. Out of sight, out of mind. No anger or spite necessarily, just getting them out of your life, and a symbolic way to do that permanently helps some people.  She already contacted her, beyond what she obviously saw at dinner when the two couples panicked.  She doesn't care. There is no problem to fix other than removing her from her life. I'd probably just unfriend, but some people need to block to remove them from their vision, or the symbolism gives them closure. shrug"	care:3,sanctity:2,authority:2_____authority:2,loyalty:2,care:2_____loyalty:3,authority:1,sanctity:1_____sanctity:1,care:3,authority:1_____sanctity:1,authority:2,fairness:1_____care:3,authority:1	0_____0_____0_____0_____0

You make suicide out to be a thoughtless, purely irrational action. However, you haven't been through it. The thoughts that everyone in your life might be better off if you didn't exist. The thoughts that even now, your absence will make the lives of the people you love better. The sheer amount of cost-benefit analyses people do in order to determine whether their life is worth the costs that everyone else has to suffer because of you.

You don't know.

This would be similar to if you went around telling women that their periods and associated symptoms are no big deal because it's just a bit of blood and some abdominal cramps. 

If you haven't experienced it yourself, I don't believe that you're qualified to write off the people that do suffer though it._____

You're right that therapy isn't the magic bullet that'll take all the pain away, but the comment you replied to never even inferred that. They said that therapy is probably a good option to pursue in order to learn how to deal with whatever you're going through.

She claims she wants to go alone because she she wants time to bond with the mentioned son, despite having 4 days off a week alone. Not about the other kid who was only mentioned in passing.

Yet she's not even going with them alone. She's also going with her friend and her friend's kid/kids.

 Every time this friend wants to get together with my wife, she never wants the family to be included.

While she stares at the t.v and you rub her legs? if she had a job, you'd both be responsible for taking care of your kids after work.
You are a doormat who has done this to yourself. She's a lazy hypoctite. But you let this happen. You have been working yourself to death rather than stand up for yourself. Guess what?

He should not have put up with her controlling financial decisions and telling him it’s because she made more, but he agreed to it. Making her the asshole for being a giant hypocrite when the tables turned. He put her through multiple failed businesses, but it sounds like she never used that as her reasoning, which is a little odd. In the end he cannot be the only asshole because he is doing exactly what she did._____
She shouldn’t have been trying on her clothes. She had no business doing that.
However. You seem more concerned with giving your kids a mother, and that’s not really fair to her. You should marry her because you love her and can’t imagine life without her. Yet you tell her she can only put her clothes in the closet if there’s room with all of your deceased wife’s clothes in there.
Grieving has no time limit and you absolutely should feel free to keep her clothes as she left them for as long as you need. But at the same time, you can’t bring in your new almost wife and tell her she can’t have closet space.

 to the extreme. They are._____. You aren't doing anything for them, you're doing it for you. For charities YOU choose.
Honestly, a children's hospital is the last place I'd donate, because they are already loaded with money.  I'd donate to a small animal rescue or a small organization that buys poor kids Xmas gifts or something. But small. Knowing they really need it and the donation goes to help. 
Instead yell them you hate gifts and if they send you something you will return in. You're free to spend your money how you want, but leave them out of it._____You just said they finally stopped gifts because you sent them back enough. You send back cards, they stop. They're still wasting postage. And now you're accepting they're cards to send to charity. Doesn't matter why, just that you accept them. You're all over with your reasoning. Return to sender with STOP in all caps. Or stop associating with people who refuse you stop sending you gifts.  If you have such a problems with anyone listening, it's because you're not being clear enough. People think that something you are sending as a gift makes you ANGRY? They stop. But no, they are angry you are pretending to donate for them,  so clearly the message wasn't received. No one is that dense. You show them gifts legit make you angry, they stop. They don't stop, you didn't make them get it. People are not that dense._____.
And let me just say that it's not an accolade for a 65 year old to be dating strippers and girls young enough to be his daughter or grandaughter. Not at all.
Let me get this straight. He needs permits, every 3 to 4 years?  No one is going to keep paying, assuming there are high fees. It taking up right of way makes it potentially dangerous for others. And he didn't need the whole motorcycle or the welding. At the minimum, use an old surfboard piece or a handlebar with a photo on a pole. And then he wants a trash and polish patrol. This is a joke, or he needs therapy to deal with his loss. Which is very very sad. He needs something to help him through this, but a 20k plan isn't it. He can go to the huge crowd for funds, but it does not all fall on you 11 to pay him back for his project. Especially when you were all probably imagining a few hundred total._____
You don't need to donate at all.
The NRA is not a charity and they do not need the money.

1) Andy is following a teaching of the church, which is to ""hate the sin but not the sinner"". While he cares about you, he probably thinks that your sexuality is a sin that deserves scorn. Similarly, he probably wouldn't hate gay people or people that adopt, but he hates the idea of it.

2) If Andy is so outspoken about this, I assume he also only wears clothes of one fiber (eg. 100% cotton), and that he is similarly outspoken against divorcees? To pick and choose what to enforce is idiotic.

Essentially, it comes down to this: is your friendship worth the knowledge that Andy probably believes that your identity is inherently sinful?_____ (You're both the assholes)

Let me start by saying that in my opinion, your friend makes a (semi) valid point. The elderly are less likely to be affected by the repercussions of the people that are elected into power. However, this doesn't mean that they don't deserve to be part of the democratic process, as there will still be many policies that affect them directly that they should have a say in.

So for your new friend, it's an asshole move to take away the votes of an entire demographic just because they might die in the future.

As for you, OP, it's an asshole move to use cancer (which is now a highly treatable disease) and morbid obesity (which increases risk for fatal conditions, but itself is not a fatal condition) as a counterpoint to your friend's. His has some (but not a lot) of justification, while yours is just a counterargument out of spite._____

He's already eating once. He may eat twice depending on if he ""feels like it or not"". He isn't coming for dinner. He's coming to visit. So you could have told him to come over *at* 6 for dinner, or *after* dinner at X time to visit, and that guests will be leaving at around X time, after which you will clean up and go to bed or go shopping. Where you'd mention that at X time it's too late because you're tired and have to work the next day.
 If you have dinner at 6, and he shows up at 9:30 and expects to stay for a while, that's terribly rude and inconsiderate of him if you have to clean up and go to bed to be up for work. 
He is not with the mother of his kid, but he's basically being her driver and picking up her kids and taking her where she needs to go. He already has dinner plans with mom, which is fine, but then *maybe* he'll have dinner with his ex's grandma as he drops her off. That could have him walking in at 9 as your last guest is leaving and you're doing clean up. 
You should have said, we are eating at X time. We are putting away food around X time. We plan to clean up and go to bed/go shopping at X time and do not want guests late because of this. If you are available before X time, please stop by, otherwise we'd love to see you Saturday for leftover pie.

Don’t do it. People like this prey on the weak. You say no, but you cave. You are estranged, she is 24 with no job history ever, and she harassed and bullied you for years. Do. Not. Do. This.

 is you don’t and you’re angry,  to yourself and your sister’s future if you do pay.
_____. You pay her almost no rent. $300 a month beats $900. Being an adult with a car means paying for car insurance. It is absolutely beyond all irresponsible to be driving without it. Being an adult means paying rent. Cleaning the house. Feeding your pets. Doing your laundry.
If your agreement for such low rent is to clean the house, you clean the house. You live with other people. Doing your own laundry is also a responsibility and no benefit to her. You don't do it, it only hurts you. You're complaining about doing things adults need to do and you want to move out, but you will owe more money and be responsible for an entire apartment! 
 If you chose not to clean the kitchen, you should have texted her that you were cleaning the living room and bathroom instead. She likely just saw the kitchen wasn't done as agreed, and blew up without seeing the other rooms were instead. 

Her response was unacceptable to say she's taking any money you get, your response that she isn't your mother and you don't want to see her again was unacceptable. Both are acting like small tempermental children. On the flip side...If your sister is 18+, and isn't paying rent or cleaning you have every right to be angry.
Mistakes were made on both sides, and both sides are clearly struggling financially. Try $900 plus $100 plus paying for cleaning supplies plus $80 Internet and still having enough for gas and food.

I am so sorry you are going through this, and I hope mods ban accordingly. 

First, report her to HR. Not only did she throw you out, and then decide to ignore you, she told other people your personal business and turned them against you. Now people are harassing you. She created a hostile working environment. She needs to be fired.

Do you really think someone who would harass someone like that should be a mother? 

Second. Your partner is an ass. You already said that you knew you'd have trouble giving it up. You'd have to come in day in and day out and hear her stories and see her photos. After the way she treated you, this would be unbearable. No. You should NOT rethink giving this bully a baby.

This is your choice. I can't imagine how hard it would be to go through all of that and give a baby up, and then see their new mom everyday on top of it.

You already thought about it, and you said you don't want to do it. If you changed your mind, this woman would be the last person you'd give a baby to.

Find a support system of someone who cares how you feel._____I'm sorry. Let me get this straight. You already wanted to end it. Then she cheated and hot knocked up. And your mom wants you to deplete your finances and raise a baby that isn't yours with a liar and cheater? With a mother like that, you don't need enemies.
 if you don't kick her as out. She's not leaving, she's counting on you to be a doormat. Stop. Tell her she has 5 days. After those 5 days, pack her things and drop them at her mom's. Stop being a chump. Smh. She and your mom and equally insane. Tell your mom she's stealing your money and having sex while you aren't home. Whatever you need to get her to butt out. Then stand up for yourself._____
Leave. She's manipulative. She's lying to her friends for sympathy. She also feels you're good enough to pay for things she needs and cover most of the bills, but not good enough to be her equal. You can do better. I'd never say that to someone I cared about, and it reveals she is just using you. She will leave when she graduates or finds a new meal ticket. She's also ugly inside to hurt you that way._____
You are dating a child. You brought yourself into that situation by being willing to accept taking care of her.  She sounds very spoiled, whiney, immature, and entitled.
She doesn't work, but she also doesn't respect your time. If she's that bored, she needs to get a job like the rest of us.
She needs to grow up and you need to stop letting her be a child. Her behavior is borderline emotionally abusive. Trying to change your behavior with guilt and anger so you do what she wants. 
Assuming she isn't an heiress...When this doesn't work out, how will you get her to leave when she depends on you? When you get tired of what she's doing?

 Two separate friends have reached out to me and told me I wildly overreacted and my best friend is hurt and depressed. Did I overreact? AITA?

HE ACCUSED YOU OF SEXUAL ASSAULT!!!!! No, you're not overreacting!!!

 edit - UPDATE: I have reached out to the friends accusing me of overreacting. Unsurprisingly, they have been told a wildly different side of the story, and my original instinct to keep the details private was a mistake, and backfired extraordinarily. The friend group is now fully aware of the extent and are trying to get in touch with him to remove the comment or post a retraction. A close, newer friend unrelated to this current situation is an employment/defamation lawyer who has done more for me in these past 4 hours than the alleged, hemorrhoid-ridden friend has done in the last decade. It’s safe to say I’ll be in good hands. Thank you for all your input, advice, and compassion; it has helped immensely! You might see me over at r/LegalAdvice in the coming days.

thank god and your good sense for that._____ People always tell me to be thankful I have a roof over my head and a family that cares, but life can still really suck with that.

you're right about that. I feel like ""look on the bright side, things could be worse"" is an OK thing to say to yourself (I certainly rely on it from time to time), but when you say it to other people you just sound like a huge asshole. Unless it's a really close friend that's getting a bit too self-pitying and needs a minor ass-kicking.

 Some of it was just bad decision making on my part, but a lot feels like it was out of my hands too. 

I have a lot of thoughts, lately, about the idea of control, and what we have control over as human beings. We're the only species (that we know of, so far) that can plan things out pretty far in advance, but there is an awful lot of stuff that we have absolutely no power to change about ourselves, and about the world. It's interesting._____

But only under certain circumstances. In this case, you already have a suspicion that this person is not trustworthy, and you're testing that hypothesis. In other words, you're not making up a story solely for the purpose of hurting another person or getting some kind of personal gain out of it. I judge this to be chaotic good, as long as you're careful that your made-up story doesn't have the potential to hurt anyone else.

But I do have to offer another suggestion: if you already know this person talks too much and tells everyone's business, then you have no need to do this. In cases like this a suspicion is enough - just don't tell that person anything really sensitive. 

There's also the fact that it might not work anyway - what if this person talks and spreads the story, but it just never gets back to you? that's a possibility._____

I'm really glad you told your friend, but I think you need to actively look for a professional to help you with this as well. What is your situation right now? are you in university, are you working, do you have health insurance, or do you live in a country with national health care?_____

You would never be the asshole for trying to protect a child. But as you say - this could destroy your friendship. Be prepared for the fallout._____ I told her friends she fucked him and they agreed with me, that she lowered herself.

and now you're trash talking your roommate behind her back with HER FRIENDS, and you still think you're a ""good guy"". amazing. 

also, if you think James is such a piece of shit that women should be warned about him, why are you friends with him?

But you probably need some relationship advice and support from people who have gone through this. I would avoid raised by narcissists subs unless your mom is completely toxic (that sub for people with extremely toxic parents, the tactics would be bad for really annoying parents)

Avoiding the situations that cause conflict can help a lot. I'm going to stick with sharing pictures but the idea will work in a few general categories.    If she wasn't invited to after Santa coffee she couldn't come early and share the pics first. Once you have the chance to share the picture first a few times you may be less annoyed if she bets you to it for a less important event.   These types of arguments can very quickly turn into downward spirals with each instance adding to the emotion of the next instance.  So having a few ""We did the thing, we took and posted pics mom was not even there so we didn't argue. That feels good"" makes it easier to then have ""A thing"" where your plan is; Ok mom is going to make a snowman with the kid I bet she will take some pictures and she's going to want to post them. I've posted the last 5/15/50 I'm ok with her posting those first.  I won't tell her to wait/I'll tell her ""go on post those"".    It's kinda like have a child who keeps stealing cookies, in that circumstance you would just remove the temptation. Stop putting the cookie on the kitchen table, hid them and when you wanted the child to have a cookie give them one.  You wouldn't never again give the child a cookie because the stole one last week and you wouldn't insist ""You are not allowed cookies until you can look at those cookies there on the table all week without taking one""That would be exhausting and frustrating to everyone.  You win the ""fight"" by taking control of the ""battlefield"" a few steps sooner in the process and not ever having the fight.    

Of course, you'll still have to have rules that she respects but it will be much easier for both of you if rather then have 50 skirmishes you avoid the conflict 49 times and absolutely stand your ground 1.

I've only given advice on one small aspect that won't solve everything or even 1/2 of it but it's a start. _____Yta and your boss and so are your friends parents who are encouraged your nonsense. 

Your boss because

They subjected a child to an unsafe work environment. You are not an adult There are reasons that are lost to protect children from being harmed on the job.

When that child was hurt they did not immediately pay the bill either with their own funds or via workman's comp/ general liability insurance. Which they 100% should have at least one of those things. This should not have been a question even for a second who paid that bill in your boss's mind.

Note had you died your boss may have been negligent enough to warrant criminal charges.

You're the a because you just stuck your parents with a $2,000 bill that is not their responsibility and not your responsibility You're being a spoiled uninformed child. 

Also why aren't you paying the bill if you think your responsible?

Your friend's parents should have told you all of this and not helping you dodge your parents._____ , story first. When my son was in grade school his best friend had a twin who was profoundly disabled. We still invented twin to every birthday party, his mom had to come and help and something my mom even helped so she could eat/use the restroom etc.  We gave disabled mom enough warning of what the party/activities would entail so she could plan accommodations. Occasionally disabled son would decline(pumpkin carving, for example, we did offer painting as an accommodation) and we made sure he had a treat bag if she wanted and picked up able son to make it a little easier on her.   This wasn't my kid but amazingly we and his mother(obviously mostly his mother) managed to come up with ways for him to participate.   Since the best you could come up with was ""carrot stick"" or ""She can watch and cry"" I don't believe you, I don't believe the only fun thing you can do as a family is ""going to the movies."" I think your efforts at inclusion are woefully lacking. 

You're the asshole for BLAMING her, you're the asshole for 2 supposedly able and capable adults not coming up with a better solution.  You're and your wife are the assholes for teaching for not teaching your step-kids kindness and empathy and I very strongly suspect encouraging them to resent your daughter because of her limitations. _____ not only are they not your kids.... You armed they, pepper spray may also be considered a weapon in schools you could get them charged with a crime and/or expelled.  You told them to destroy the bullies life, I hate bullies but this bully is also a child. 

You should seek professional help, your judgment is severally impaired.  _____Just FYI I got you did some stuff. 

But if you think you are depressed, have an overall unmotivated life, are depressed and are setting a bad example.  TRIP is not the answer. Addressing the day to day, week to week and month to month stuff is way more helpful.   A one-time thing you do every 5,10,20 years and not doing the day to day stuff isn't setting a good example and isn't suitable for good mental health. 


Take the kids to the park and play with them or other psychical activities. Spots, jumping place whatever. 

Pursue something intellectual with the kids/family and on your own.

Pursue something artistic/creative same as above. 

Try something you've never done before. 

Go out with your wife.

Pursue something social. 

Interact with nature 

Learn about other cultures, art, politics whatever.  

The people with the busiest lives the ones who played sports, took vacations, worked full time, built the kids floats for high school, went out with their friends had BBQs are the people I see now in their 70s who can still do the most stuff the ones who worked and did the basics cause they were just too tired to do more are doing nothing in retirement and frankly don't seem 67 they seem 85. 

It's not a one of trip that will make the difference but good habits and healthy balance in day to day life.  Doing stuff now gives you the energy to keep doing it.  If you want to be a better husband, father and person start today do it now don't put it all on this trip.  

And one more time if you are depressed get help. _____ you're child your rules but ""being civil to others in their homes"" is almost as important as science and ""think for yourself"".  I'm mildly agnostic, sons father is rabidly Born again Christian, kid is an atheist or Church of Satan(as in getting science clubs in schools along with religious clubs not literally ""hail satan"" if anyone didn't know what it meant) on a grumpy day.  

You don't have to like someone's beliefs or share them but you categorically need to be civil being furious that a known religious person suggested saying grace and calling it mumbo jumbo isn't being civil.

There are so many REAL threats that your child will be exposed to in the future, but you can’t be there to protect them from those. As a parent, your job is to prepare them to be a functional adult, but you’re not preparing them for that. The only thing you’re teaching them is how to hide stuff from you.

Your overprotectiveness and paranoia is based on something that happens so infrequently it’s closer to an excuse than an actual reason._____

1) You're a teenager, and I firmly believe that a child should only be brought into the world if they can be cared for properly. Not saying that teenage parents can't be good parents, but it's obviously more difficult for a teenager to care for an infant than it is for a grown adult.

 Right now it may seem like her issues are her own issues. She's dating guys who are old enough to be her father,  which is pretty disgusting considering she is still a teen, and just out of high school or worse, about to graduate in 6 months. If she's just turned 18, she skipped a grade as a kid. That's on her.
But she also chose to get animals she is responsible for, and she's trying to bring a child into that mess of a life she has. Which is unforgivable. She's not just hurting herself then. She needs an intervention.
The valedictorian thing couldn't matter less.
It's that she is an irresponsible and selfish human. Animals she can't take care of or afford, that's her being a shit person. They will suffer. Her trying trying to get knocked up by some random guy when she has perverted older men taking care of her. When that baby somes, you can bet she will mooch off your parents,  and if they're stupid. ..
So yes, I think she's headed down a track that should make the family write her off and tell her to get her shit together or they can't be a part of her life. Tough love because right now she's spoiled thanks to your parents refusing to make her grow up, and family allowing her to stay in their home. Enabling her.
Take the valedictorian out though. She doesn't need to be like the rest of you, as long as seen can be a decent human who isn't tanking her life and behaving recklessly. Which, she is not.
Maybe being cast out like a black sheep will force her to get her shit together. This isn't working what is happening now. _____I'm not going to attack and harass a complete stranger on the internet, because abuse didn't turn me into a bully with blind rage towards others that dare disagree with me after I attack them. This attitude displays a complete lack of awareness because it says the victim may be too ""poor"" or stupid to help themselves. Which victimizes them all over again. Saying the OP shouldn't give them a wake up call and try to warn them and get them to fight against the one thing that can imprison them forever is blind and ignorant. If she's ""stupid"", then give her information. Help her find time. Telling the victim that its ok to do nothing only traps them as a victim. It's how victims stay trapped in these situations. No one telling them what they can do, no one giving them options, no one telling them they can be strong in just ONE thing. And it's one tiny little thing she can be proud of. A small step. People who can't afford these things are given help, especially in light of these situations. It would be free. The more you know._____
Modeling school is a waste of time and a scam. You are trying to wake her up to her looks and personality not being right, before she destroys her chance at a future. Her ""teachers"" have also been blunt and honest but your parents are deluded and keeping it from her. In this case, lying will harm her._____. But judgemental? Yes.
Jane is a bitch. MH is a loser with no brain and no future.
Jane told him things that you said in confidence to start shit. He started shit with you and she did nothing. He then threatened you and she blamed you. Jane is trash.
However. Don't knock the ""community college"" hs program. It makes you seem stuck up and not considering that people can't afford ""a good school"" because not every plays sports at all, much less well enough to get a scholarship. Not everyone can afford college and the smart thing to do is take gen eds at a community college or tech school or even a 2 year university because it is literally the same damn thing credit wise and less than half cost wise. No one cares if you went to x school all 4 years. Dumb as he is, he is going to be ahead of everyone else. Until he drops out because he's a trash human. _____
So your sister is from the family vacation where you both wore thongs, and they roasted you for being “indecent” and she wasn’t. She calls you names and makes fun of you for being bigger than her.
Obviously you don’t want her there, but your family are hypocritical assholes so it doesn’t matter.
You made a peanut dish and explicitly TOLD her. She pretended she didn’t know so she could act like a victim. If her daughter is so allergic that being in the room with peanuts cooked can hurt her, your sister willingly put her in danger just to make you look bad. Anyone calling you an asshole missed that. Your sister is toxic and so is your family, based on your last post. You probably should include that they fat shamed you and she harasses you and they side with her. Point blank tell them you won’t host dinners. You shouldn’t have to be around someone like that._____SHP/ Is she mentally retarded? No seriously. To behave like a 3 year old...
You gave a kid a $40 fish and just threw it in a bag? With no regard for the safety of the fish? The length of time in bag? The fact that they probably don't have a tank at all, and the fish would likely die? If they did have a tank,that they probably wouldn't introduce it correctly? Even then, can you trust her to not shake or break the tank or poke it? You essentially not only gave the fish a death sentence,  but you taught a brat that if she throws a big enough fit, she can get what she wants.
That entire family needs to be avoided and he needs to get her help. "	care:5,sanctity:3,loyalty:2,authority:2,fairness:1_____care:8,authority:1_____fairness:3,care:2,sanctity:1_____sanctity:2,care:2,loyalty:1_____loyalty:1,care:3,sanctity:1_____fairness:1,loyalty:1,care:3	1_____0_____1_____0_____1

We've moved away from the ""clean your plate"", ""eat anything we put in front of you"" as a healthy mindset about food.   You don't cook the 1-10 foods you hate the most, right? in general, it's perfectly healthy both physically and developmentally to have food you won't eat.  Adults make this decision at the grocery store.  Food tastes different to different people such as people who cilantro tastes like soap, I mean you wouldn't each something that literally tastes like your licking a bar of soap?  I don't eat beets they taste like dirt, coincidentally I don't like sweet potatoes either.  Has she been tested for allergies? 

And I'm unclear about ""leftovers"" does that mean she ate her potatoes yesterday? and you just still have leftovers or that she has to eat yesterday's potatoes before she gets any other food? how long are you going to play chicken with that?  Based on this being ""how you were raised"" I'm guessing this isn't a new rule and in general, so I'm inferring from she eats her vegetables and isn't normally a fussy eater.  Getting into a tearful battle over 1 food with a kid who normally eats ""well"" is an asshole move._____ your GF acted like a spoiled child.  I want to note one thing she didn't have to eat, if she was that repulsed by the food (even though it sounds really good) you say something nice and ""Something disagreed with me from lunch I just can't eat."" if you're(general you) so picky you can't eat a few bites when offered a wide variety of food then you never make dinner plans with people unless you are in complete control of the menu. She should have eaten on the way home. _____ you don't invite someone to stay with you for several days and expect them to ask permission to have a snack.  You can totally ask him to pitch in on the cost of food and do a delivery order together.

Also you're a bad host, if you're trying to follow the formal etiquette for guests (that they may not get their own food) you are obligated to offer food and drinks so often they would never have to ask for a snack._____ if you didn't want to waste food you could have ordered from the kids menu and then finished her leftovers.  See if it was really about the waste there was another solution. or if this bugs you can go with ""we need to start always paying for our own meals"" that might make you annoying to some people and rude in some circumstances but it wouldn't make you an asshole.  

Telling an adult to order from the extremely limited kids menu is being an asshole.  If they had lunch or 1/2 portions that would have been ok. 

Involving your friends in a petty argument is also an asshole move._____, while she may be wrong or exaggerating BUT sneaking in gluten or anything she says she is intolerant to into her food would be wrong and if it makes her sick it could be a crime.  It's morally reprehensible to trick people into eating things they have stated they can't/won't eat.  It applies to allergies, religious or ethical reasons.

If he's not willing to seek mental healthcare, I really encourage you to consider whether you want to stay in this relationship.  Depression sucks.  Agoraphobia is becoming more common during this pandemic.  He may benefit from medication.  If he's already on it, he needs an adjustment. 
 Staying in bed is only going to make him feel worse in the long run and he needs a plan to return to the real world.  Can you go for a distance walk or picnic with a friend?  I think picnics are easier because you can set up far away from one another.  Statistically, you're unlikely to get sick when you go out, especially when you're taking precautions.  

I don't love ultimatums, but ""If you don't get mental healthcare and stick with it, our relationship will not survive.

 since we live in a tiny house, a full time indoor cat for the remainder of his life just didn't seem feasible.

Given that your cat suffered multiple injuries even before this, all due to being allowed to roam outside:
 a stitched up stomach due to it being cut open after him being stuck under a fence and an almost lost ear from his glory days along with other small tweaks

given that, letting him go outside was what wasn't feasible. You should have rehomed your own cat to someone who could take proper care of him, not stolen your neighbors._____First of all, I agree that cat owners shouldn't let their cats wander onto other people's property.
But this is an  situation.
  They are feeding a cat they originally thought was a stray as well as another one. 

But now they know he isn't one. I get that they're trying to feed another cat, but if that cat belongs to yet another family, they shouldn't feed him either. You don't feed animals without their owner's permission.

 Unless you keep your cat indoors or on your own property, you have no right to get angry at them.

This is why we have the  tag, because the OP being at fault and the other person being at fault aren't mutually exclusive. _____.

It's not okay to feed other people's animals without the owner's permission. It's far worse after the owner has explicitly told you not to.

And you're the opposite of an asshole for telling them to stop. You're protecting your cat's health. 

6 lbs in a few months is a huge amount for a cat. I've seen cat obesity when I was volunteering at a shelter, and it is a serious health concern for them, (weight reduction can be very dangerous for them if done incorrectly and should be done under the guidance of a vet). You do not want this happening to your cat._____I have a dog that I love deeply, and I don't think it's inherently any different from a moral perspective to eat a cat or dog than to eat another species.

There are stories of genuine animal abuse of dogs in cultures that eat them, and that's wrong, but would be wrong with any species. I think there is more potential to end up eating someone's lost or stolen pet, which would be horrific but that's not the case with OP eating pork.                                                                            

I also used to have pet rats, but I've never judged anyone for trying to kill wild rats._____: 

(1) You guys should be consulting a vet about how much to feed them, (she's probably right about the cat being fat,and the gravity feeder was probably part of the reason it got that way, but helping cats lose weight is a tricky process because underfeeding too drastically can be dangerous for them)

(2) and you should be open about your disagreement with her, not feeding them behind her back and then trying to rehome them behind her back._____

(1) Your friend is 16, so still living with her parents in their house. If they don't want the cats on furniture, etc, they can lay down that rule, but since it's allowed, presumably they're fine with it.

(2) Yes, cat saliva is unsanitary. So is raw meat, but dishes that held raw meat and other risky things get washed (I assume her family isn't vegan) and you don't seem worried about that. As long as good dishwashing techniques are used, it's not something to worry about.

(3) Cats do need baths, and not everyone realizes that, but they're not in your house and they're not suffering from it, so it's not really your concern.

(4) Kissing cats is slightly unsanitary, but if she's a healthy person it's not that much of a risk and is none of your business."	care:2,authority:1,sanctity:1,fairness:1_____care:2,loyalty:2,authority:1_____care:3,authority:2_____care:2,sanctity:2,fairness:1_____care:4_____care:2,sanctity:1,loyalty:1	0_____0_____1_____0_____1

Even if you raised your voice , not the asshole. Even if you were really mean about it not the asshole.  IDK what your disagreeing roommate are on about, maybe it's their age, maybe they don't think girls being pervs is possible or harmful, maybe they don't like conflict and were uncomfortable. I will say it's not uncommon for people to just want their discomfort to stop and to then tell the victim to ""stop"" enforcing normal healthy boundaries on the perpetrator. She's the one crying and yelling they want that to stop more then they care she stops walking in on you. 

Being deaf/partially deaf has nothing to do with this. Shes not waling in on anyone else/no-one else is walking in on each other because multiple people are sharing a bathroom and everyone worked out ""knock"" or the door is closed someone is using the bathroom. 

The best solution is probably a doorstop/hotel lock. Speaking to your landlord about installing a privacy door knob.  Normally I would tell you to just install the knob yourself but since you only have one roommate agreeing that might make your life more difficult with the other 4 roommate (I don't care and neither should you about pervy girl but the other 3 could make your life a pain in the ass for what 5 more months?)_____ , you already know why you're not the asshole. So does everyone else here.  So I'm going to spend some more time on why your mom's ...

 Smartphones are weird and new, you have the entire world in your pocket.  That whole world includes a lot of ""places"" its perfectly reasonable for you to be forbidden to go.  You wouldn't take a 14 year old to a strip club or a BDSM dungeon that allowed full penetration, right?  It's not that I don't trust you but you're 14 your impulsive and can wander into something you don't have enough context for yet.  

But more importantly, much more importantly.  While the vast majority of people are good, there are a small % who are really terrible.  30 years ago, I could have some idea of who you were hanging out with and where, your friend's would have to call the house phone. So that 30 year old weirdo from down the block , your friends older sibling, your friends parents, a friends cousin from Albuquerque, the youth pastor;  I would have know that they were coming to met you kids at the park, at the arcade and inviting you to watch movies at their house and maybe I would notice you smell of beer and I certainly would have noticed the 40 year old man dressed at as school girl at a sleep over(catfishing).   All of these people are in your pocket now all the time and I have no fucking clue what the red flags are anymore and no idea how to spot them.  I can assure you of one thing that every one of your parents either was themselves or known someone who was either molested, raped or taken advantage of by an adult. We all knew a 14 year old who had a 19 (but was really 24+ year old boyfriend)  We all knew someone whoes coach was super cool and let the kids come over and drink beer and watch left porn out or had a dad who walk in while while the girls where changing during sleep overs or had a mom who ""dropped"" her towel all the time.  We can tell you ""don't take candy from strangers in vans"" but that's not what really happens , what really happens is someone that you know right now wants to hurt children. We don't know which someone.  You know a few hundred people and all but 1 or 5 of them are lovely but the 1 who is not lovely has 24/7 unsupervised access to you. 

TLDR we're scared for you and don't know how to protect you.
_____ because 2 wrongs don't make a right. Not wanting or accepting being yelled at while you're trying to help super reasonable. 

P possibly, you're the asshole if she is in declining mental health and lacking compassion.  I'm not talking about respect the elderly here I'm talking about compassion and empathy when people get ill and/or start losing it in old age.

your family is the asshole because even if she needs help now a few hours of being yelled at in no position they should be leaving you in. 

_____ Because you believed him. If he held a gun to someone else's head and said ""If you don't have sex with me I'll kill this person."" that would be rape.  He's just holding the figurative gun to his own head. 

You do need some help with learning how to deal with this, that doesn't make you an asshole it makes you uninformed.  Tell his family he is suicidal if he makes another threat to commit suicide then call 911.  Please do not break up with him in person.   If he is suicidal then it's not your fault, its mental illness but some people develop this as a manipulation tactic. _____, she's the asshole because she's wrong, you don't hurt people by telling them the bullshit people say behind their back. Hey if you were planning on marrying someone and she overheard ""I'm going to marry Didit, take out a large insurance policy and then kill them"" that you need to know but rando on the bus you don't.  ""Is it necessary"" that how you decide whether to repeat something, repeating something ugly to ""keep you informed"" is just spreading the ugly.

You have an actual feeding disorder, not an eating disorder. There are feeding specialists who work with empirically proven methods of diagnosis and treatment of this (I follow a speech therapist, Melanie potock, who works with children with these disorders). You need to stand up for your sister in law, and tell everyone that they were incredibly rude to her to your sister in law. Stand up for yourself too, tell them that they chose to use you and your texture based feeding disorder as a weapon to attack someone, and that’s not right. Tel them they embarrassed you, and you deserve an apology as well. You should Consider apologizing to her as well, even though you can not help your texture defensiveness, you can apologize that your family decided to focus on your disorder instead of focus on how nice of a time everyone was having._____, tell her that it’s just easier to go out.

dressing up for Church is all about You, and how you think other (humans) are gonna judge you.     IMO that's missing the point of going to church.  also one of my favorite priests ever told me this  ""Religion is about bringing you closer to God,  if you're asked to do something that's going to make you feel further away from God,  don't do that"" 

  

Being so hard core about presentation is likely gonna drive a wedge between your daughter and God,  and i doubt that's what you actually want.   its also going to drive a wedge between you and her,  again,  not what you want. 

  

my two cents.    hope you have a great weekend :)_____so only  evangelical anti-sex puritanism, but  fundamental Islam anti-sex puritanism is fine?  or what about atheists? 

I think you're falling into a narrative / tribalism. 

I'm just anti puritan , for any and all religions. 

but i'm also for keeping public spaces kid / family friendly. 

Want to open a sex/toy shop in my neighborhood , with in a mile of the park i take my kids too?  I don't care, go ahead. 

Want to walk hand in hand with your S.o in the park,  small PDA, 
go ahead i don't care,  don't care what your orientation is either. 

want to walk naked , with sex toys out, or engage in sex acts in a public space,   I'm drawing a line there.   Hard line (pun intended, hey lets keep it fun lol) 

And now i've gone full circle.    some actions may move progress forward and gain allies with out creating any ill will.   some actions may gain allies but create enemies.    I'll stick with the former and avoid the later,  best of luck with how ever you chose to engage with people. :)_____

   sexual dysphoria  is when you are born XX and feel like you are really a guy,  or born XY and feel like you are a women.  her son already has that condition. 

  

I'm all for respecting rights of transgender (marriage, voting, insurance, right to work, etc, etc) 

But medical treatment needs to be based upon actual pluming that is present (not what is desired) 

  

If i needed medicine that needs to be dosed by body weight ,  I need you to measure the  amount that is correct for my FAT self.   not the thin athlete I want to be. _____so you're right, objectifying people isn't sexist,  and if its a small part of your view of people its not problematic.  

  

Everyone does it,  Its why Fabio ,  Ryan Renolds, Aria Granda, Kardashians  are all famous.  

if most of humanity didn't hollywood would be 100% average looking people. Hell just look at historical statues, paintings, etc.  Beauty is partially how we view good health.   we (humanity) worships good health._____ -   also if she's the really hot  jogger i see every day while driving into work, she absolutely can not stop wearing though, i mean , she looks really ... Comfortable. 

  

serious note,  if you trust your wife, then you trust your wife and its not really an issue, just sorta Icky (to have other guys drooling over the person you love)    but  that's a biology problem  (guys are highly visual when it comes to sex and sexual attraction)   and just a catch 22 ,  If she's working out hard enough to drop 50 pounds  she's gonna be hot (temp wise) and sweating if its 60+ out   some sorta yoga pant / shorts + sports bra is really the best clothes she can wear for her goals._____

  

(Facts, not opinions) 

  humans are sexually dimorphic .   those born XY have larger hearts   lungs (proportional to their body mass)  more upper body mass, more grip strength and longer arms compared to their frame. 

  

Men on average have a arm span  1.023 times their height 

women on average have a arm span  1.016 their height 

[

  

(unless they are doing shot put, javelin Arm length won't matter, i'm just show casing some differences between those born XX and XY) 

  

Opinion

that said there is really no fair solution.   its unfair to girls on opposing teams to place against someone who is physically male 

and its unfair for the person who feels like they are a girl, that they have to compete on the guys team.  its also unfair if they can't compete at all. 

:(

Don’t let people drive your car, the people who want to borrow your car can not afford one of their own, and you’re basically saying, “I trust you with one of most expensive things I’ll ever own.” YOU are the one responsible for the car, and anything else that car hits. Your car insurance covers your car, not the driver.

I don't go often enough, honestly, but my aunts church had a thursday night church where a little mini communion happened and I would take a small piece of bread and eat it just out of respect, but we're also not Catholic. My aunt and uncle are Presbyterian, so I don't think communion is as big of a deal, and it wasnt the ""first Sunday of the month"" communion either. 

Short answer: on occasion. If communion at my church was done in the specific way of going up to the priest at the front and taking it, then no, I would stay in my seat. The Thursday night church I went to was far more relaxed and.. not proper. 

As for the topic of the Jewish faith and reading passages, I would ask them if it was okay for me to read it rather than assume it was not. If they're okay in sharing their religion and having someone who doesn't believe read the prayer, I would read it.

If you go to a party and they have meat made that's going to be thrown out after the party unless it's eaten and you still refuse: you're not helping anything. You're actually part of the problem. If you wanted to be ""part of the solution"" my recommendation is to be a real ""by choice"" vegetarian. Don't buy meat for yourself, don't order it, don't cook it. But if offered or it's already made? Eat it. Otherwise it's gonna get tossed and wasted and you haven't REALLY helped anyone._____ - and wtf?? your family is not ""the government"". I'm an adult and if I open something for one of the kids, I have a ""opener fee"" where I get a drink/bite/piece of whatever it is. They know my fee and ask me for help choosingly (it's great because then I don't need to open easy things for them and they have to make an effort first). 

But just random ""food tax""??? That's something in their family, it doesn't have to rub off to you if you don't like it, and your BF should respect that. 

It is silly though. That said, I usually stab people (gently, mods, not for real) with my fork when they try to steal food off my plate without first asking._____. First of all, i hate to say if but if you're dating a Filipino gal, you're gonna have to learn to deal with  Filipino food. Personally, I love that shit. But this isn't about me.

Relationships are about compromise, which to be fair you did try by suggesting other places to eat. She might have been a little pushy, but you seem to have been incredibly dismissive and argumentative. Why not do Filipino food that week, Indian food the next.

Figure out something that works, or if you can't agree then pick a random place out of a hat. _____Hi, I'm a server. I am, however, white. I don't necessarily have to deal with this kind of racist bullshit.

However, I have a young cousin who is mentally about 6. When we go out to eat Asian food she constantly does the things ops sister does. We correct her behavior and explain its not okay and she apologizes for it and stops. Its that easy. If a child can figure it out and if we can be upfront with her, op should be able to as well._____.

My cousins are girl scouts and my house is the cookie headquarter for their troop, my aunt and uncle are the cookie parents. On valentines day we had HUNDREDS of cookies packed into our garage that we had to sort through. V-day (thursday) we got cookies, spent Friday and some of saturday sorting cooking. Saturday night and all of sunday night was pick up for the girls troop. Monday I sorted through my cousins cookies and got the cookies out that I sold. Today, six days later, 23 out of 25 bags of cookies (60+ boxes) have been delivered to the people that ordered them.

My point here? She's not busy, she's lazy. You prepaid and bought cookies, march yourself over there and pick up your cookies and next year, ask her for the online line. (You can order GS cookies during pre-order time online, right through their website. You need a scout link so that girl scout gets the credit for it, but this way you get them within 10 days. You have to, however, pay shipping. But some people want them bad enough. I think there's also a 4 box minimum...)
